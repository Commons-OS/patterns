# Psychological Safety (Edmondson)

## 1. Overview

Psychological safety is a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking. It is a climate in which people are comfortable expressing and being themselves. They are confident that they won't be embarrassed, rejected, or punished for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes. The term was coined by Harvard Business School professor Amy C. Edmondson in the 1990s. [1] Psychological safety is not about being nice or lowering performance standards. It is about creating a culture of openness where people feel they can be candid, and where they can share their failures and learn from them. This is critical for innovation, growth, and overall team effectiveness. [2]

In a psychologically safe environment, team members feel accepted and respected. This sense of security allows them to focus on collective goals and problem-solving without the fear of negative social consequences. It is a crucial ingredient for high-performing teams, as it unlocks the full potential of each member and enables the team to learn and adapt in the face of challenges. The concept has gained significant traction in recent years, particularly after a study by Google, known as Project Aristotle, identified psychological safety as the most critical factor for successful teams. [5]

## 2. Core Principles

The core principles of psychological safety are rooted in creating an environment of trust and respect, where individuals feel secure to contribute fully. These principles include:

*   **Inclusion and Diversity:** Team members feel safe to be their authentic selves without fear of negative consequences. This includes embracing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. A culture of inclusion ensures that everyone feels a sense of belonging and is empowered to contribute their unique talents. [3]
*   **Willingness to Help:** Team members are willing to help each other and are open to being helped. This fosters a collaborative and supportive atmosphere where individuals are not afraid to ask for assistance or admit they don't have all the answers. This principle is fundamental to effective teamwork and knowledge sharing.
*   **Attitude to Risk and Failure:** Failure is viewed as an opportunity for learning and growth, not as a reason for punishment or blame. This encourages experimentation and innovation, as team members are not afraid to take calculated risks. A healthy attitude towards failure is essential for continuous improvement and breakthrough performance.
*   **Open Conversation:** Open, honest, and respectful communication is encouraged. Team members feel comfortable sharing their ideas, concerns, and questions without fear of retribution. This principle is the bedrock of psychological safety, as it enables the free flow of information and ideas, which is essential for effective decision-making and problem-solving. [4]

## 3. Key Practices

Building psychological safety requires intentional effort and consistent practice. Some key practices include:

*   **Frame the work as a learning problem, not an execution problem:** This encourages a mindset of curiosity and experimentation, where the focus is on learning and improving rather than simply getting things done. This approach helps to reduce the fear of failure and encourages team members to take on new challenges.
*   **Acknowledge your own fallibility:** Leaders who are open about their own mistakes and limitations create a safer environment for others to do the same. By modeling vulnerability, leaders can help to break down hierarchical barriers and create a more egalitarian team culture.
*   **Model curiosity and ask a lot of questions:** This encourages others to speak up and share their perspectives. By asking powerful questions, leaders can stimulate critical thinking and encourage a more inclusive and participatory decision-making process.
*   **Create structures for input:** Regularly solicit feedback and ideas from all team members. This can be done through a variety of channels, such as team meetings, one-on-one conversations, and anonymous surveys. Creating formal and informal mechanisms for input ensures that everyone has a voice and that their contributions are valued.
*   **Embrace messengers of bad news:** Thank people for bringing problems to your attention, as this encourages transparency and helps to prevent small issues from escalating into major crises. A culture that shoots the messenger will quickly find itself in the dark.
*   **Destigmatize failure:** Share your own failures and what you learned from them. This helps to create a culture where failure is seen as a natural part of the learning process, rather than something to be ashamed of. By celebrating intelligent failures, organizations can foster a culture of innovation and continuous improvement.
*   **Set boundaries and create space for conversation:** Ensure that everyone has an opportunity to contribute. This may involve setting ground rules for meetings, such as no interruptions, or creating dedicated time for open discussion and brainstorming. [6]

## 4. Application Context

Psychological safety is applicable in any context where people work together in teams, from small startups to large corporations, and across all industries. It is particularly crucial in environments that are complex, uncertain, and fast-paced, where continuous learning and adaptation are essential for success. For example, in healthcare, psychological safety is critical for patient safety, as it enables medical professionals to speak up about potential errors without fear of blame. [7] In the tech industry, it is essential for fostering the innovation and creativity that drives new product development. In the financial services sector, it can help to prevent catastrophic failures by encouraging employees to raise concerns about risky or unethical practices. [8]

## 5. Implementation

Implementing psychological safety is a multi-faceted process that requires a combination of leadership commitment, team-level interventions, and supportive organizational systems. It is not a one-time initiative, but rather an ongoing practice of creating and maintaining a culture of trust and respect. The implementation process can be broken down into several key stages:

**1. Assessment and Awareness:** The first step is to assess the current level of psychological safety within the organization. This can be done through a variety of methods, including surveys, focus groups, and one-on-one interviews. The goal of this stage is to gain a clear understanding of the existing climate and to identify areas for improvement. Once the assessment is complete, it is important to raise awareness of the importance of psychological safety throughout the organization. This can be done through workshops, training sessions, and internal communication campaigns. [9]

**2. Leadership Development:** Leaders play a critical role in creating a psychologically safe environment. They must be trained and developed to model the desired behaviors, such as vulnerability, curiosity, and active listening. Leadership development programs should focus on building emotional intelligence, coaching skills, and the ability to create inclusive team environments. Leaders must also be held accountable for fostering psychological safety within their teams. [10]

**3. Team-Level Interventions:** Psychological safety is ultimately experienced at the team level. Therefore, it is important to implement interventions that are specifically designed to improve team dynamics. These interventions can include team-building exercises, communication training, and the establishment of clear team norms. For example, teams can create a 
team charter that explicitly outlines their commitment to psychological safety and defines the behaviors that are expected of team members. [11]

**4. Organizational Systems and Processes:** Finally, it is important to align organizational systems and processes to support psychological safety. This includes performance management systems that reward collaboration and learning, as well as policies and procedures that promote transparency and fairness. For example, organizations can implement a "just culture" approach to incident investigation, which focuses on learning from mistakes rather than blaming individuals. [12]

## 6. Evidence & Impact

Research has shown that psychological safety has a significant positive impact on team performance and organizational outcomes. A study by Google's Project Aristotle found that psychological safety was the most important factor in building a successful team. [5] Other studies have shown that psychological safety is associated with increased creativity, innovation, and employee engagement. It has also been linked to improved decision-making, problem-solving, and overall team effectiveness. The impact of psychological safety is not limited to team performance; it also has a positive effect on employee well-being, leading to lower levels of stress and burnout. Case studies from a variety of industries have demonstrated the tangible benefits of investing in psychological safety, from improved patient outcomes in hospitals to increased sales and customer satisfaction in retail. [8]

For example, a study of a large financial services company found that teams with higher levels of psychological safety were more likely to report errors and near misses, leading to a reduction in costly mistakes. [8] In the healthcare sector, research has shown that psychological safety is a critical factor in preventing medical errors and improving patient outcomes. [7] A study of a manufacturing company found that teams with higher levels of psychological safety were more likely to engage in process improvement activities, leading to significant gains in productivity and quality. [13]

## 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

In the cognitive era, where work is increasingly knowledge-based and collaborative, psychological safety is more important than ever. The rapid pace of technological change and the increasing complexity of work require teams to be agile, adaptable, and innovative. Psychological safety is the foundation upon which these capabilities are built. In an era of automation and artificial intelligence, the uniquely human skills of creativity, critical thinking, and collaboration are becoming increasingly valuable. Psychological safety is essential for unlocking these skills and enabling teams to thrive in the cognitive era. As routine tasks are automated, the ability to solve novel problems and create new value will become the primary differentiator of successful organizations. This requires a workforce that is not afraid to experiment, take risks, and learn from failure – all of which are hallmarks of a psychologically safe environment.

Furthermore, the cognitive era is characterized by an increased emphasis on data and analytics. Psychological safety is essential for creating a data-driven culture, as it encourages employees to share their insights and challenge assumptions. In a psychologically safe environment, team members are more likely to question the data, identify potential biases, and offer alternative interpretations. This can lead to more robust and reliable decision-making. The cognitive era also presents new challenges for psychological safety. The rise of remote work and virtual teams can make it more difficult to build trust and rapport. Organizations must be intentional about creating opportunities for connection and collaboration in a virtual environment. [14]

## 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

Psychological safety aligns with the principles of the commons in several ways. It promotes a culture of collaboration, knowledge sharing, and mutual support, which are all essential for a healthy commons. It also fosters a sense of shared ownership and responsibility, as team members feel empowered to contribute to the collective good. The seven dimensions of commons alignment are:

1.  **Openness and Transparency:** Psychological safety encourages open communication and transparency, which are core principles of the commons.
2.  **Collaboration and Cooperation:** It fosters a collaborative and cooperative environment, where team members work together for the collective good.
3.  **Shared Purpose and Values:** It helps to create a sense of shared purpose and values, which are essential for a strong commons.
4.  **Inclusivity and Diversity:** It promotes inclusivity and diversity, ensuring that all voices are heard and valued.
5.  **Fairness and Equity:** It helps to create a fair and equitable environment, where everyone has an opportunity to contribute and succeed.
6.  **Sustainability and Resilience:** It fosters a culture of learning and adaptation, which are essential for the long-term sustainability and resilience of the commons.
7.  **Distributed Governance and Decision-Making:** It empowers team members to participate in decision-making, which is a key principle of distributed governance.
