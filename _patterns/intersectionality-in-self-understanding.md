Recognising that you simultaneously hold multiple identities—race, class, gender, ability, sexuality, neurology—each carrying distinct privileges and oppressions, is commons literacy.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Identity Theory.

---

### Section 1: Context

Commons work operates in a field of human identities, yet most collaboration frameworks treat participants as interchangeable units. In organisations, people bring their full selves—but policy treats them as roles. In government, public servants design for "citizens" as abstractions. Activist movements splinter when some members experience safety differently. Tech products scale features without recognising that accessibility, privacy, or notification defaults land differently across differently-positioned bodies.

The system state is fragmented: silos between identity communities, repeated harm cycles where well-intentioned spaces exclude without knowing why, and shallow solidarity that collapses under pressure. Intersectionality in Self-Understanding interrupts this fragmentation at the root—the individual practitioner's own capacity to see themselves clearly.

When a facilitator, product designer, policymaker, or organiser doesn't recognise their own layered position—that they might simultaneously hold majority power in one axis while experiencing marginalisation in another—they become a vector for invisible harm. They design from assumed universality. They speak over people whose constraints they don't perceive. They build systems that work perfectly for people like themselves while creating friction elsewhere.

This pattern activates in the moment a practitioner becomes curious about their own simultaneity: "I have read access in this room but no voice in that one. I belong here but not there."

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Intersectionality vs. Understanding.**

The tension runs between two truths that don't resolve into unity:

**Intersectionality** (the reality side) says: You hold multiple identity positions at once. Some grant you power, resources, visibility, safety. Others withdraw these. The intersections create emergent effects—a Black woman's experience of gender is not additive (Black + woman) but fundamentally shaped by the interaction. You cannot check one off a list.

**Understanding** (the false resolution) says: Let me map these out, categorise them, perhaps rank them by salience. Now I understand my position. Now I can design or lead from here.

The problem: Understanding reifies what intersectionality names as fluid. Once you've "identified" your position, the work stops. You've created a stable self-portrait when the actual landscape is relational and contextual—your privilege shifts as you move between rooms.

Real consequences surface:

A well-meaning activist recognises their class privilege and stops listening to working-class comrades—guilt becomes paralysis. A tech leader understands they're a woman in tech and becomes blind to their racial majority status, shipping features that serve only English-speakers. A government officer maps their disability experience onto policy and assumes all disabled people need identical accommodation.

The breakdown: Without intersectional self-understanding, practitioners unconsciously replicate the hierarchies they're trying to dissolve. With shallow understanding (a checklist completed), they become rigid—defending a fixed position rather than staying alive to how their positionality shifts across contexts and relationships.

The pattern fractures collaborative capacity. Trust erodes. Newly visible harms go unaddressed because the person causing them believes they already "understand."

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, a practitioner develops a living, contextual map of their own simultaneous identities and the specific power flows attached to each, practices updating it as they move through different relational fields, and uses it as a compass for where their blindspots likely are—not a destination they've arrived at.**

The shift is from *static self-knowledge to dynamic relational awareness*.

Identity Theory tells us the self is not a fixed container of traits but a process—continuously constructed through social interaction. You are not "a woman" or "a man" in the abstract; you perform and experience gender relationally. In some rooms you're hypervisible as a woman; in others, your gender recedes and class becomes the salient axis. Intersectionality names this multiplicity as *simultaneous*, not sequential.

The mechanism works by cultivating three capacities:

**Recognition of simultaneity**: You hold multiple identity positions at once, right now, even if you're only conscious of one. A white disabled person has immediate awareness of disability oppression (constant, lived) but often floats unaware through white privilege (it feels like air—invisible advantage requires another person pointing it out). The practice: inventory the axes (race, class, gender, sexuality, disability, citizenship, neurology, religion, body size, accent, formal education, homeownership). Note which ones you experience as salient (where you feel constraint). Then ask: *Where might I have majority status that feels invisible to me?* This isn't a thought exercise; it's ecological reconnaissance.

**Contextual shifting**: Your position is not fixed across relational fields. You might be a racial majority in your workplace but a minority in your family of origin. You might have class privilege in your neighbourhood but financial precarity in your broader ecosystem. The practice: before entering a collaborative space, ask *Where do I likely have power here? Where do I likely have constraint? Where is my blindspot—the axis where I probably don't see my own privilege?* This becomes your soil report. It tells you where to listen harder, where your default solutions might be invisible to others.

**Compass, not destination**: The point is not to achieve perfect intersectional consciousness (impossible) but to maintain a living practice of noticing. This keeps the system vital rather than rigid. Each time you discover a blindspot, the map updates. You become allergic to certainty about your own position.

In commons terms: this pattern seeds the conditions for genuine reciprocity. When a facilitator knows their own positionality, they can hold space for others' without unconsciously centring themselves. When a product team understands its members' intersecting identities, they can design with intentional plurality rather than defaulting to the majority user. When a movement member has this literacy, they can call in comrades from a place of solidarity rather than shame.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**For activists**: Run a "positionality caucus" before major campaign design. Gather core organisers and ask each person (in writing first, then sharing aloud): *Name one axis where you hold majority privilege in this room. Name one axis where you hold minority status. What decisions about this campaign might you be blind to?* Use the answers not to assign roles but to design the decision-making structure itself. If your anti-poverty campaign is designed only by people who've never experienced poverty, your positionality practice catches that gap and creates space for differently-positioned expertise. Repeat this before each campaign phase—positionality isn't a one-time audit.

**For organisations**: Embed intersectionality into hiring and promotion review. When evaluating a candidate or promoting an internal person, the review panel explicitly considers: *What perspectives and experiences does this person bring? Where do our current team have blindspots?* Not to fill a "diversity box" but to strengthen decision-making. A finance team of all cis men, regardless of race and class diversity, will miss gendered patterns in how salary and equity are distributed. Create a practice where at least one person in any hiring decision names their own positionality aloud: "I'm a straight cis man from a wealthy family, which means I likely don't see economic barriers others experience. I'm watching for that." This isn't confession; it's ecological honesty.

**For government**: Integrate intersectional self-assessment into policy impact analysis. Before a public service rolls out a new program, the design team answers: *How do the axes of identity shape who can access this? Who designed it and what were their blind spots?* A public housing program designed by people who've never experienced homelessness will miss crucial friction points. A healthcare system designed without disabled people's input will create barriers. Concretely: require one "positionality impact statement" in every policy memo—one paragraph where the author names their identity position and where they likely need additional input.

**For tech**: Build intersectionality into product accessibility reviews, not as a separate "accessibility compliance" step but as a live practice. Before shipping a feature, ask: *Who are we designing for? Who becomes invisible? What identity positions did the builders bring, and where are our blindspots?* When your engineering team is 90% people with neurodiverse backgrounds and 70% men, the product will be optimised for speed and novelty over stability and consistency—exact blindspots. Invite differently-positioned people (disabled users, elderly users, non-English speakers, people with low digital literacy) into testing not as an afterthought but as co-designers. Their positionality isn't a constraint to manage; it's signal.

**Across all contexts**: Create a "positionality anchor" document that each practitioner or team updates quarterly. It names (1) which identity axes are salient in this work, (2) which ones carry majority and minority status for each member, (3) where the collective has blindspots, (4) who we need to listen to and why. Share this in onboarding. Treat it as a living artifact, not a policy document.

---

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

A practitioner with living intersectional self-understanding becomes a better listener. They stop defending positions and start tracking *where they might be wrong*. This generates genuine reciprocity—the foundation of commons work. Collaboration deepens because people experience being seen and believed.

Organisations and movements that embed this practice become more adaptive. When blindspots are named rather than hidden, they get corrected faster. A campaign that knows its positionality can intentionally recruit people whose perspectives it lacks, rather than unconsciously replicating itself. This increases both resilience (more viewpoints = more scenario planning) and stakeholder architecture (4.5 score reflects this strength).

Teams become safer. When someone notices they've unconsciously spoken over a person with less formal education, and they can name it as "oh, I have educational privilege here"—not as shame but as ecological fact—the relationship can repair. Blame converts to understanding. This renews vitality.

**What risks emerge:**

Rigid checklist implementation creates false consciousness. A team completes a "diversity audit" and decides they've "done intersectionality," when in fact they've simply photographed a moment. The practice becomes hollow—a one-time workshop rather than living literacy. Watch for: language that's past-tense ("we've addressed this") instead of present-tense ("we're noticing").

Performative positionality—people naming their identities without shifting their behaviour—can actually corrode trust. If a leader says "I'm a white man with class privilege" and then continues making decisions without consulting people affected, the confession becomes gaslighting. The pattern fails when self-awareness doesn't connect to accountability.

The scores (resilience: 3.0, ownership: 3.0, autonomy: 3.0) reflect a real limitation: this pattern sustains existing health but doesn't generate *new adaptive capacity* by itself. It's hygiene, not innovation. A movement that only practices intersectional self-understanding without structural change will eventually fracture. The pattern must be paired with concrete power-shifting (removing decision-making from those with blindspots, creating shared ownership across difference).

Decay signals: When practitioners start speaking of their positionality as fixed ("I'm a cis straight white man, so I can't speak on this"), the pattern has rigidified. When people use positionality statements as permission to exit hard conversations ("Well, I'm a guy, so what do I know"), implementation has curdled.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Incite! Focus on Social Justice and Gender Justice (US activist networks):** For over two decades, Incite! has embedded intersectional self-understanding into their organising model. Before each campaign, organisers name their positionality—not in confession circles but in strategy sessions. This isn't abstract: it directly shapes who makes decisions. When Incite! designed their Violence Against Women of Color framework, they centred that the experience of gender violence is not uniform; it's racialized, classed, shaped by disability, immigration status. The difference: they didn't interview survivors as research subjects. The core organisers *were* women of colour experiencing these intersecting systems. Their positionality wasn't a liability to manage; it was the foundation of the analysis. The practice survives because it's baked into each decision point.

**Mozilla's Trustworthy AI Team (Tech):** Mozilla recognised that algorithmic bias isn't primarily a technical problem—it emerges from what blindspots the engineers don't see. They began requiring that any team shipping an AI feature included people from different identity positions in the design process, and that each team member explicitly stated: "Here's where I think we have blindspots." A team of engineers from privileged backgrounds designing content moderation will default to protecting speech over safety. A team including people from communities targeted by harassment will balance differently. Mozilla didn't force this as policy; they cultivated it as literacy. The result: their content moderation systems caught hate speech patterns that other platforms missed, because the team could see what they were blind to.

**UK Government's Disability Unit (Public Service):** When the Disability Unit was established, they required that any policy memo include a "positionality section" answering: *Who designed this? What experiences do they bring? Where are we likely blind?* One early memo about remote work policy came from people assuming all disabled people wanted flexibility. The positionality practice surfaced that some disabled people need rigid routine and in-person support. The policy shifted. The practice didn't solve disability justice—structural barriers remained—but it prevented the pattern where "good intentions" replicated harm. The key: positionality wasn't treated as a box to check but as a real question that sometimes changed policy direction.

---

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an AI-saturated landscape, this pattern becomes both more urgent and more distorted.

**The urgency:** AI systems are trained on data reflecting the blindspots of their builders. If your training dataset was created by people unaware of their own positionality, the AI learns and amplifies those blindspots at scale. An AI trained on hiring data from companies with historical discrimination will be *more* discriminant than the humans it replaces—statistically. An AI trained on image datasets weighted toward lighter skin tones will fail to recognise darker skin. These aren't bugs; they're inherited blindspots made invisible by mathematics.

The commons answer: before any AI system enters collaborative space, the team building it must explicitly map their positionality and use that map to audit training data and design choices. Not as compliance, but as ecological practice. *Who did not contribute to this dataset? What voices are missing? Where is our blind spot likely to be?*

**The distortion risk:** AI introduces a seductive false solution—the algorithm as neutral arbiter. Teams start believing that if they remove human judgment and let the system decide, positionality doesn't matter. This is backwards. Removing human positionality consciousness doesn't eliminate bias; it hides it. A hiring algorithm trained to optimise for "cultural fit" will exclude people whose identity differs from the majority without anyone noticing why—the decision appears mathematical, not human.

The tech context translation therefore requires practitioners to do *more* intersectional self-understanding, not less. Before deploying any AI in a commons (a platform, a recommendation system, a moderation tool), the team building it must be able to name: *Where are our positionality blindspots? Where is the algorithm likely to replicate them? Who should we include in testing to catch what we can't see?*

**New leverage:** Distributed intelligence and networked commons actually strengthen this pattern. Instead of centralised teams making decisions, you can create genuinely plural design spaces where differently-positioned people co-create. Intersectional positionality stops being a compliance audit and becomes a strength signal: "We need X perspective in this conversation; who has that lived experience?"

---

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

A practitioner quietly names a blindspot mid-meeting ("I just realised I've been speaking only to people in suits—let me hear from people over there") without needing external prompting. The pattern is alive when it's intuitive, not performed.

A team redesigns its decision-making structure based on positionality mapping—not theoretically, but actually removing certain people from certain decisions because they have too much blind spot. And the team members agree. This means the practice has shifted behaviour.

A person notices contradictions in their own position and can sit with them ("I have privilege here and constraint there, and I need both to inform how I show up") without collapsing into either guilt or false confidence. This is the sign that understanding has become alive and relational.

Over time, fewer "surprises" about whose needs were missed. The blindspots the practice identified actually prevent harms—specific, nameable harms that didn't happen because the team saw them coming.

**Signs of decay:**

Positionality language becomes a script: "As a white woman, I defer to..." (performed vulnerability without actually listening differently). The statement happens; the behaviour doesn't change.

Teams complete intersectional assessments once yearly and then never revisit them. The practice becomes a photo, not a living map. You hear: "We already did this."

A practitioner invokes their positionality as reason to *exit* difficult work ("I'm a man, I can't speak on this") rather than to *enter* it differently. The pattern has inverted.

Decision-making structures stay identical even after positionality mapping reveals gaps. The analysis is sophisticated; the power distribution unchanged. Vitality decays when awareness doesn't generate structural change.

**When to replant:**

When a team has experienced a specific harm (a blindspot that caused actual damage) and can trace it back to positionality that wasn't surfaced, that's the moment to restart the practice with more rigour. Don't wait for annual review; intervene immediately.

When new people join a commons, restart positionality mapping. The landscape shifts. What was visible becomes hidden; new blindspots emerge. This is not repetitive maintenance; it's essential renewal.
