### Section 1: Context

Most collaborative systems today operate in scarcity—of time, attention, capital, and decision-making bandwidth. Teams stewarding commons (whether digital infrastructure, natural resources, or shared governance) face an ecosystem overloaded with choice: which tool, process, policy, or investment avenue will serve the collective best? The system is often fragmenting under the weight of endless evaluation loops. Decisions stall. Stakeholders grow exhausted. Opportunity costs accumulate while perfectionism masquerades as rigor. In corporate settings, this manifests as decision committees that spiral through optimization cycles. In activist networks, it appears as campaigns delayed by consensus-seeking around the "ideal" strategy. Government bodies get caught in policy analysis paralysis. Tech teams run A/B tests on features that could ship now. The commons assessment reveals that satisficing sustains vitality without generating new adaptive capacity—it keeps the system alive but doesn't inherently make it more resilient or creative. The pattern emerges as a corrective when you recognise that exhaustive maximisation *is itself a design choice*, and often a costly one.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Satisficing vs. Maximizing.**

Maximizing says: evaluate all reasonable options, identify the objectively best one, and only then act. It promises optimal outcomes. It appeals to our intuition that more information and deliberation yield better results. But maximizers face a brutal trade-off: the time and cognitive load required to find the true best option grows exponentially. Each new option evaluated introduces doubt about whether you've truly exhausted the search space. Regret follows: "If only I'd looked one more time, I might have found better." Satisficing says: define clear criteria for "good enough," evaluate options against those criteria, and commit to the first (or next few) that meet the threshold. It's fast. It frees mental energy. But satisficing practitioners risk settling for mediocre outcomes when a small additional search effort would yield substantially better results. They may miss signals that their criteria are misaligned with actual need. The tension becomes acute in commons contexts because the cost of paralysis is distributed: everyone's time compounds, stakeholder trust erodes, and windows of opportunity close. Yet setting a satisficing threshold poorly can embed mediocrity into the system's baseline, slowly sapping resilience. The pattern works only when the threshold itself is calibrated thoughtfully, not defaulted to convenience.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, define satisficing thresholds collaboratively at the start of any decision cycle, then enforce a commitment boundary once an option meets that threshold.**

The mechanism is elegant: by making the satisficing criteria *explicit and shared*, you transform what might feel like lazy compromise into a legitimate collective design choice. Herbert Simon observed that humans always satisfice—we don't have the computational capacity to truly maximise in complex environments. Satisficing Over Maximizing doesn't pretend we can maximise; it makes satisficing visible, intentional, and collectively owned.

The shift happens in three moves. First, the group pauses before searching and articulates what "good enough" means for *this decision, in this context, with these constraints*. Not abstractly good enough, but grounded: "This tool must integrate with our existing infrastructure, cost under €5k annually, and have a support channel responsive within 24 hours." Those criteria become roots. Second, once you've set the threshold, you commit to a bounded search horizon—not infinite evaluation, but deliberate and time-limited. You might interview three vendors, run pilots with two, then decide. You don't interview ten. Third, the moment an option crosses the satisficing line, you *stop searching and decide*. This is the hardest move, because it requires genuine cultural acceptance that "first good option" is a legitimate outcome.

In living systems terms, satisficing acts like a thermostat on metabolism. A system that maximises burns too much energy on evaluation; one that satisfices randomly burns too little and loses direction. Satisficing Over Maximizing sets a healthy metabolic rate. It releases energy for implementation, for learning by doing, for course-correction based on real-world signal rather than theoretical optimisation. This is how resilience actually grows: not from perfect initial decisions, but from committed action that generates feedback.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**In corporate settings, operationalise satisficing as Decision Protocols:**
Create a template for any decision above a cost or stakeholder-impact threshold. The template requires three entries: (1) the decision's scope and deadline; (2) satisficing criteria written in measurable language ("reduces manual data entry by at least 60%," "maintains current security posture," "onboarding takes <2 hours"); (3) the search horizon ("speak with three vendors," "run 72-hour pilot," "gather feedback from two key user groups"). Once you've listed these, you run the search to *those bounds*, then decide. This works because it makes the satisficing threshold visible to stakeholders—no one feels blindsided by a "good enough" choice that secretly failed to consider an alternative, because the search scope was explicit from the start.

**In government, embed satisficing in Policy Drafting Cycles:**
Replace open-ended policy development with satisficing gates. A policy proposal must meet baseline criteria (constitutional alignment, fiscal impact <X% of budget, addresses stated harm in published research) before advancing to stakeholder comment. This isn't lowering standards; it's clarifying which standards are non-negotiable and which are nice-to-have. Government moves slowly partly because it tries to anticipate every future scenario. Satisficing criteria help: "This zoning policy must protect the floodplain (non-negotiable), accommodate 20% population growth over 10 years (non-negotiable), and achieve some carbon-reduction co-benefit (nice-to-have, but not a blocker)." Once a draft meets those thresholds, you publish it. You learn in implementation, not in endless pre-drafting.

**In activist networks, practice Good Enough Activism by setting Campaign Minimums:**
Before a campaign launches, the coordinating group defines what success means: "We need 500 verified sign-ons, media coverage in at least two regional outlets, and a commitment to a single listening meeting from the decision-maker." The campaign runs until those thresholds are met—then you escalate or pivot. This is radically different from "run until we can't anymore" or "run until we've reached all possible supporters." The satisficing frame acknowledges finite volunteer energy and prevents the spiritual rot that comes from exhaustion-driven activism. It also creates natural moments to evaluate: "We hit our threshold. What did we learn? Is the threshold still right?"

**In tech teams, implement Satisficing Threshold criteria for MVP and Deployment:**
For any feature, define satisficing in terms of user value delivery: "Ship when core flow completes in <3 seconds, error messages are clear, and at least 80% of beta users complete the intended task." Don't wait for 95% success rate or microsecond performance; hit the threshold and ship. Measure in production. This pattern underpins agile itself, though many teams regress toward maximising within sprints. Satisficing Threshold AI becomes crucial when machine learning models are involved: set a performance floor ("validation accuracy >85%, false-positive rate <2%") and a retraining schedule ("retrain monthly" or "retrain when performance drifts >5%"). Don't chase the perfect model; deploy the good-enough model and evolve it with real data.

**Across all contexts, install a Satisficing Veto:**
Anyone in the decision group can invoke the veto once per cycle: "I believe our criteria are missing something essential for this decision." This isn't a blocker veto; it's a *recalibration veto*. The group stops, revisits the threshold, and either adjusts it or the person commits to the original. This prevents both tyranny-of-low-standards and tyranny-of-endless-deliberation.

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:** Energy returns to the system. Decisions move from analysis paralysis into committed action. Teams that adopt satisficing thresholds report faster cycle times and lower decision fatigue. More importantly, you create feedback loops: because you're implementing sooner and measuring real outcomes, you learn whether your satisficing criteria were actually aligned with impact. This accelerates adaptation. You also build psychological safety around "good enough"—people stop treating decisions as moral verdicts and start treating them as experiments. In commons terms, this strengthens **autonomy** (teams can decide faster within clear boundaries) and **fractal value** (the pattern scales: each sub-team can define its own satisficing thresholds, creating coherent diversity). Stakeholder trust often improves because the reasoning is transparent.

**What risks emerge:** The most dangerous failure mode is *criterion drift*: what starts as a thoughtful satisficing threshold gradually becomes a rubber stamp for mediocrity, especially if implementation routines become rote. You stop asking "Is this threshold still right?" and start asking "Did we hit the threshold?" This hollows the pattern. The **resilience score (3.0)** reflects this risk: satisficing sustains but doesn't strengthen adaptive capacity. A system that satisfices consistently without periodically upgrading its thresholds becomes brittle—it keeps functioning until the world changes and it's no longer adequate. Second risk: gaming the threshold. Teams may calibrate criteria low enough to avoid real deliberation, or define them so narrowly that they exclude legitimate concerns. Third: satisficing can embed inequality if the threshold-setters represent only some voices. A team that satisfices on "good enough for us" without centring affected communities may land on solutions that work for insiders but fail for those downstream.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Herbert Simon's Bounded Rationality in Organisations (1957–1970s):** Simon observed that real decision-makers—managers, engineers, scientists—never actually maximised. They operated under time pressure, incomplete information, and cognitive limits. Rather than seeing this as a deficiency, Simon named it: people *satisfice*. They set an aspiration level and search until they find an option that meets it. This wasn't weakness; it was adaptive. Modern satisficing practice in corporate strategy explicitly uses Simon's framing: "We set a target for return on investment (satisficing threshold), evaluate opportunities until we find three that clear the bar, then choose among those three based on fit and timing." Companies like 3M have famously used satisficing thresholds ("allocate 15% of time to experimental projects") rather than trying to identify the theoretically optimal innovation mix.

**Barry Schwartz and the Paradox of Choice (2004 onward):** Schwartz documented that maximisers—people who tried to find the best option in every domain—reported lower life satisfaction, more regret, and higher depression than satisficers. When tested with consumer choices, maximisers spent more time deciding, second-guessed themselves more, and reported less happiness with their purchases. His work sparked a cultural shift: teams began installing satisficing explicitly. A well-known example comes from food procurement: a university cafeteria reduced its cereal options from 300 to 10, and satisfaction *increased*. People could now satisfice (pick a good option quickly) instead of maximise (agonise over optimal nutrition). This translated directly into workplace settings: design teams adopted satisficing thresholds for tooling choices, reducing the "which Slack alternative" decision from 6 months to 2 weeks.

**Local Government Policy Satisficing in the UK (2015 onward):** Several UK councils, facing austerity, adopted explicit satisficing in service delivery. Rather than trying to optimise every policy, they defined satisficing criteria: "A library closure proposal is evaluated on these five factors: usage patterns, alternative access points, cost savings, and community impact. If a closure meets the threshold on four, it advances." This removed the endless deliberation loop and created predictable, defensible decision pathways. The pattern worked—decisions moved faster, and communities, though sometimes disappointed, respected the transparency. One council leader noted: "We stopped waiting for the perfect answer and started making good decisions we could explain."

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age of AI and distributed intelligence, satisficing takes on new urgency and new danger. The urgency: AI systems excel at generating options. A language model can brainstorm 50 campaign messages in seconds; a recommendation engine can rank 10,000 vendors. This *looks* like it should make maximising easier—just ask the AI for the best option. In reality, it explodes the search space and triggers analysis paralysis at scale. Teams using AI for decision support now need satisficing *more*, not less, because the tool can always generate one more option.

The new leverage: AI can help *articulate* satisficing criteria. A team can say to a language model: "Generate three vendor options that meet these criteria" rather than "Find me the best vendor." The AI becomes a satisficing filter, not an oracle. This is Satisficing Threshold AI in practice: you define the threshold, the AI generates candidates that clear it, you choose. This actually works better than asking AI to find the objective best, because thresholds are human-interpretable and testable.

The new danger: over-reliance on AI-generated thresholds. If an AI system generates satisficing criteria ("cost <€10k, uptime >99.5%, response time <500ms"), teams may adopt them without collaborative calibration. The criteria look data-driven, so they feel legitimate, but they may not reflect actual needs or values. The system loses the human deliberation that makes satisficing meaningful.

The practical move: In AI-augmented commons, make satisficing criteria *explicitly human-authored* before asking AI to filter. Use AI as a search tool, not a threshold-setter. And install a temporal boundary: "We evaluate AI-recommended options for 72 hours, then decide, regardless of how many options the system could generate." Otherwise, you've simply automated paralysis.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**
Observe decision velocity: decisions move from meeting-to-meeting timelines to week-to-week. Watch for commitment language: "We hit our threshold, so we're shipping this Thursday." Notice that people spend energy on *implementation and learning* rather than re-evaluating past choices. Look for distributed threshold-setting: multiple teams within the commons are calibrating their own satisficing criteria—the pattern has taken root. One clear signal: when someone proposes reopening a decided question, the group's first response is "Does our satisficing threshold no longer hold?" rather than "Let's reconsider from scratch."

**Signs of decay:**
Watch for threshold erosion: criteria that were once specific ("response time <500ms") become vague ("pretty fast"). Notice regret-heavy language: "We should have looked harder before we chose that tool." See patterns of late-stage pivots: a tool ships, gets used for weeks, then gets replaced because the initial satisficing was too loose. Detect hollow ritual: the group goes through the satisficing checklist but isn't actually *deciding* at the threshold—they're checking boxes and second-guessing afterward. Most dangerous: when thresholds become invisible. If people can't articulate the satisficing criteria, the system has decayed into unmarked compromise.

**When to replant:**
Reset satisficing criteria annually or whenever the system's context shifts significantly—new stakeholders join, external constraints change, or the team's capacity expands. The moment you hear "We chose this three years ago based on criteria that no longer make sense," that's the signal to replant. Don't discard the pattern; recalibrate it. Bring the group together, revisit what "good enough" means now, and recommit.
