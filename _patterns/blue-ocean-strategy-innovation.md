### 1. Overview

Blue Ocean Strategy is a business theory and framework for creating new market space and making competition irrelevant. Developed by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne, the strategy posits that sustainable high performance is better achieved by creating new demand in uncontested market spaces (“blue oceans”) rather than competing in existing, saturated markets (“red oceans”). Red oceans are characterized by well-defined industry boundaries, established competitive rules, and a zero-sum game where companies fight for a greater share of existing demand. This often leads to commoditization, price wars, and shrinking profit margins. In contrast, blue oceans represent untapped market space, where demand is created rather than fought over. By pursuing differentiation and low cost simultaneously, a concept known as “value innovation,” companies can unlock new opportunities for profitable growth. This approach encourages a shift in mindset from competing to creating, from fighting over a shrinking pie to growing the pie itself. The core of Blue Ocean Strategy is to identify and unlock new value for customers while simultaneously reducing costs, thereby creating a leap in value for both the company and its buyers.


### 2. Core Principles

Blue Ocean Strategy is built upon a set of fundamental principles that guide organizations in their quest to create uncontested market space. These principles provide a systematic way to break from the competition and create new demand.

1.  **Reconstruct Market Boundaries:** This principle challenges the conventional wisdom of accepting market boundaries as given. Instead of competing within existing industry confines, Blue Ocean Strategy encourages looking across alternative industries, strategic groups, buyer groups, complementary product and service offerings, the functional-emotional orientation of an industry, and even across time. By systematically exploring these paths, companies can identify new market spaces that are often overlooked.

2.  **Focus on the Big Picture, Not the Numbers:** This principle emphasizes the importance of a clear strategic vision over getting lost in the details of financial modeling and forecasting. The primary tool for this is the **Strategy Canvas**, a diagnostic and action framework that graphically captures the current strategic landscape and the future prospects for a company. It helps to visualize the company's strategic profile and identify the factors that the industry competes on and where the company can diverge.

3.  **Reach Beyond Existing Demand:** To create a blue ocean, companies should look to noncustomers rather than focusing on existing customers. By understanding the commonalities across noncustomer tiers, companies can unlock new sources of demand. This involves shifting the focus from segmentation and targeting to desegmentation and broadening the market.

4.  **Get the Strategic Sequence Right:** This principle provides a framework for building a robust and sustainable business model. The sequence involves evaluating buyer utility, setting a strategic price, achieving a target cost, and addressing adoption hurdles. A commercially viable blue ocean idea must create a leap in value for the buyer, be priced to attract the mass of target buyers, be profitable at that price, and have a plan to overcome any adoption barriers.

5.  **Overcome Key Organizational Hurdles:** Even a brilliant Blue Ocean Strategy can fail if it is not executed properly. This principle identifies the four key hurdles to strategy execution: the cognitive hurdle (waking employees up to the need for a strategic shift), the resource hurdle (overcoming limited resources), the motivational hurdle (motivating key players to act), and the political hurdle (overcoming opposition from powerful vested interests). Tipping point leadership and fair process are key to overcoming these hurdles.

6.  **Build Execution into Strategy:** This principle integrates strategy formulation and execution. By involving employees in the strategy-making process and ensuring that the process is perceived as fair, companies can build a culture of trust and commitment that facilitates execution. This fosters voluntary cooperation and ensures that everyone is aligned and motivated to implement the new strategy.


### 3. Key Practices

Blue Ocean Strategy is not just a theory; it is a highly practical and actionable framework. It provides a set of tools and methodologies that enable organizations to systematically create blue oceans. These practices help to translate the core principles into concrete actions.

1.  **The Strategy Canvas:** This is the central diagnostic tool and action framework for building a compelling blue ocean strategy. It serves two purposes: to capture the current state of play in the known market space, which allows you to understand where the competition is currently investing, and to reorient your focus from competitors to alternatives and from customers to noncustomers of the industry. The horizontal axis of the canvas captures the range of factors the industry competes on and invests in, while the vertical axis captures the offering level that buyers receive across all of these key competing factors.

2.  **The Four Actions Framework:** This framework is used to reconstruct buyer value elements in crafting a new value curve. It poses four key questions to challenge an industry's strategic logic and business model:
    *   **Eliminate:** Which of the factors that the industry takes for granted should be eliminated?
    *   **Reduce:** Which factors should be reduced well below the industry's standard?
    *   **Raise:** Which factors should be raised well above the industry's standard?
    *   **Create:** Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered?

3.  **The Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create (ERRC) Grid:** This is a supplementary tool to the Four Actions Framework. It is a simple matrix that pushes companies not only to ask the four questions in the Four Actions Framework but also to act on all four to create a new value curve. The grid provides a tangible way to visualize and organize the changes to the value factors.

4.  **The Six Paths Framework:** This framework provides a systematic way to reconstruct market boundaries and create blue oceans. It helps managers to look beyond the traditional boundaries of competition to find uncontested market space. The six paths are:
    *   **Path 1: Look Across Alternative Industries:** Competing not only with the other companies in its industry but also with companies in other industries that produce alternative products or services.
    *   **Path 2: Look Across Strategic Groups Within Industries:** Strategic groups are groups of companies within an industry that pursue a similar strategy. The key is to understand what factors determine buyers’ decisions to trade up or down from one group to another.
    *   **Path 3: Look Across the Chain of Buyers:** In most industries, competitors converge around a common definition of who the target buyer is. In reality, there is a chain of “buyers” who are directly or indirectly involved in the buying decision.
    *   **Path 4: Look Across Complementary Product and Service Offerings:** Untapped value is often hidden in complementary products and services. The key is to define the total solution buyers seek when they choose a product or service.
    *   **Path 5: Look Across Functional or Emotional Appeal to Buyers:** Some industries compete principally on price and function based on calculations of utility; others compete largely on feelings; their appeal is emotional. The key is to challenge the functional-emotional orientation of an industry.
    *   **Path 6: Look Across Time:** All industries are subject to external trends that affect their businesses over time. By looking across time from the value it delivers today to the value it might deliver tomorrow, a company can actively shape its future and lay claim to a new blue ocean.

5.  **The Pioneer-Migrator-Settler (PMS) Map:** This is a tool for visualizing a company’s portfolio of offerings. **Pioneers** are the blue ocean businesses that offer unprecedented value. **Settlers** are the me-too businesses that are stuck in the red ocean. **Migrators** are businesses with value improvements that are somewhere in between. The PMS map helps managers to see where their portfolio stands and to shift the balance towards pioneers.


### 4. Application Context

Blue Ocean Strategy is applicable across a wide range of industries and organizational types, from large corporations to small startups, and even non-profit organizations. It is particularly relevant in situations where an industry is characterized by intense competition, commoditization, and shrinking profit margins. When companies find themselves trapped in a red ocean of bloody competition, fighting for market share and struggling to differentiate themselves, Blue Ocean Strategy offers a systematic way to break free and create new growth opportunities.

The strategy is not limited to technology-driven industries or new economy businesses. In fact, many of the most powerful examples of Blue Ocean Strategy come from traditional industries such as manufacturing, entertainment, and even the public sector. The key is not the industry itself, but the strategic mindset of the organization. Companies that are willing to challenge the conventional wisdom of their industry, question the long-held assumptions about who their customers are and what they value, and are prepared to make bold strategic moves are the most likely to succeed in creating blue oceans.

Furthermore, Blue Ocean Strategy is not just for creating new businesses. It can also be applied to revitalize existing businesses that are facing declining growth and profitability. By applying the tools and frameworks of Blue Ocean Strategy, companies can identify new value-cost frontiers and reinvent their existing offerings to create new demand. This makes it a powerful tool for both entrepreneurs and established companies seeking to achieve sustainable high performance.


### 5. Implementation

Implementing Blue Ocean Strategy is a systematic process that involves a series of well-defined steps and the application of specific analytical tools. The goal is to move from a red ocean of competition to a blue ocean of uncontested market space in a way that is both strategic and manageable. The implementation process can be broken down into the following key phases:

**Phase 1: Getting Started**

The first step is to select the right scope for the blue ocean initiative and to build a dedicated team. It is crucial to choose an area where the need for a new strategy is most pressing and where the organization has the capabilities to make a real impact. The team should be cross-functional, comprising members from different departments and levels of the organization, to ensure a diversity of perspectives and to build broad-based support for the initiative.

**Phase 2: Understanding the Current State of Play**

This phase involves developing a deep understanding of the current strategic landscape. The primary tool for this is the **Strategy Canvas**, which is used to map the current strategic profile of the industry and the company's position within it. This helps to identify the factors that the industry competes on and where the company's strategy converges with that of its competitors. The team should also analyze the pain points of the industry and identify the compromises that customers are forced to make.

**Phase 3: Reconstructing Market Boundaries**

This is the creative heart of the Blue Ocean Strategy process. It involves systematically looking for new market space by applying the **Six Paths Framework**. The team should explore each of the six paths to challenge the conventional boundaries of the industry and to identify new opportunities for value innovation. The goal is to find a new value curve that is radically different from that of the competition.

**Phase 4: Formulating the Blue Ocean Strategy**

Once a potential blue ocean opportunity has been identified, the next step is to formulate the strategy. This involves using the **Four Actions Framework** (Eliminate, Reduce, Raise, Create) to reconstruct buyer value elements and to create a new value curve. The **ERRC Grid** is a useful tool for this purpose. The team should also develop a compelling tagline that captures the essence of the new offering and communicates its value proposition clearly and concisely.

**Phase 5: Making the Blue Ocean Move**

The final phase is to execute the Blue Ocean Strategy. This involves developing a robust business model that ensures the strategy is both profitable and sustainable. The **Sequence of Blue Ocean Strategy** (Buyer Utility, Price, Cost, Adoption) provides a framework for this. The team should also address the key organizational hurdles to execution by applying the principles of **tipping point leadership** and **fair process**. This will help to build a culture of trust and commitment and to ensure that the new strategy is embraced by the entire organization.


### 6. Evidence & Impact

The impact of Blue Ocean Strategy on business performance has been a subject of considerable interest and research since its introduction. The evidence, drawn from a multitude of case studies and academic analyses, suggests that when successfully implemented, the strategy can lead to significant and sustained profitable growth. The creators of the strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne, studied over 150 strategic moves in more than 30 industries over 100 years and found that the companies that created blue oceans were able to reap the benefits for 10 to 15 years without credible challenges [1].

One of the most iconic examples of Blue Ocean Strategy in action is **Cirque du Soleil**. By blending the traditional circus with theater, it created a new form of entertainment that appealed to a whole new audience of adults and corporate clients, who were willing to pay a premium for a sophisticated and artistic experience. This allowed Cirque du Soleil to achieve rapid growth and high profitability in an industry that was in long-term decline [2]. Another notable example is **Nintendo's Wii**. Instead of competing with Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox on processing power and graphics, Nintendo created a new market for casual gamers with its motion-sensing technology and intuitive gameplay. The Wii appealed to a much broader demographic, including families and older adults, and became a massive commercial success [3].

However, the pursuit of blue oceans is not without its challenges and risks. Critics of the strategy point out that not all blue ocean creations are successful, and some may even lead to spectacular failures. The case of **JCPenney's attempted transformation** under CEO Ron Johnson serves as a cautionary tale. Johnson's attempt to move the company to a blue ocean by eliminating discounts and creating a more upscale shopping experience alienated its core customer base and resulted in a massive drop in sales [4]. This highlights the importance of a deep understanding of the market and a carefully planned implementation process.

Furthermore, some academics have argued that the distinction between red and blue oceans is not always clear-cut and that many so-called blue oceans are eventually colonized by competitors, turning them into red oceans over time. They also point out that the strategy may not be suitable for all companies or all industries, and that a focus on competitive strategy may still be relevant in many situations. Despite these criticisms, Blue Ocean Strategy remains a powerful and influential framework that has inspired countless companies to rethink their approach to strategy and to search for new ways to create value and drive growth.

### 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

The advent of the Cognitive Era, characterized by the proliferation of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data, presents both new opportunities and challenges for the application of Blue Ocean Strategy. These technologies can act as powerful enablers for creating blue oceans, but they also have the potential to accelerate the process of market colonization, turning blue oceans red more quickly than ever before.

On the one hand, AI and data analytics can significantly enhance the process of identifying and creating blue oceans. For example, machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze vast datasets of customer behavior, market trends, and noncustomer insights to uncover hidden patterns and unmet needs. This can help companies to more effectively apply the Six Paths Framework and to identify new market spaces with greater precision and speed. AI-powered tools can also be used to simulate different strategic scenarios and to test the viability of new value curves before making significant investments.

On the other hand, the Cognitive Era may also lead to a more rapid commoditization of new market spaces. As AI technologies become more accessible, competitors may be able to quickly replicate the value innovation of a blue ocean creator, eroding their competitive advantage and turning the blue ocean red. This means that companies will need to be even more agile and innovative to stay ahead of the curve. They will need to continuously monitor the market landscape, leverage AI to anticipate competitive moves, and be prepared to make their next blue ocean shift sooner rather than later.

Furthermore, the ethical implications of using AI in the context of Blue Ocean Strategy must be carefully considered. For example, the use of personal data to identify and target noncustomers raises important privacy concerns. Companies will need to ensure that they are using these technologies responsibly and transparently to build trust with their customers and to avoid a public backlash. In the Cognitive Era, a successful Blue Ocean Strategy will not only be about creating new market space, but also about doing so in a way that is ethical, sustainable, and aligned with the values of a digital society.


### 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

Blue Ocean Strategy, at its core, is a framework for creating new market space and unlocking new demand. While its primary focus is on achieving profitable growth for the firm, its principles and practices can be assessed for their alignment with the concept of a "commons" – a shared resource that is managed for the collective good. The alignment of Blue Ocean Strategy with a commons-based approach is not inherent, but rather depends on the specific application and the values that guide its implementation.

**Potential for Positive Alignment:**

*   **Value Innovation for the Common Good:** The principle of value innovation, which seeks to create a leap in value for both the company and its buyers, can be extended to include society as a whole. When a blue ocean creation addresses a significant societal need or challenge, it can generate substantial positive externalities. For example, a company that creates a blue ocean in the field of renewable energy or affordable healthcare is not only creating a new market but also contributing to the well-being of the commons.
*   **Nondisruptive Creation:** The concept of nondisruptive creation, a key element of Blue Ocean Strategy, is particularly well-aligned with a commons-based approach. Unlike disruptive innovation, which often leads to job losses and social disruption, nondisruptive creation seeks to create new industries without displacing existing ones. This can lead to a more inclusive and sustainable form of economic growth, where new opportunities are created without destroying the old.
*   **Focus on Noncustomers:** By reaching beyond existing demand and focusing on the needs of noncustomers, Blue Ocean Strategy can help to address issues of social exclusion and inequality. When companies create new offerings that are accessible and affordable to previously excluded populations, they are not only expanding their market but also contributing to a more equitable society.

**Potential for Negative Alignment:**

*   **Enclosure of the Commons:** A potential risk of Blue Ocean Strategy is that it can lead to the enclosure of the commons. When a company creates a new market space, it may be tempted to protect it through aggressive intellectual property strategies, creating barriers to entry and limiting access to the new value it has created. This can stifle innovation and prevent the benefits of the new market from being widely shared.
*   **Exploitation of the Commons:** In their quest for new market space, companies may be tempted to exploit common resources without regard for their long-term sustainability. For example, a company that creates a blue ocean in the tourism industry may do so at the expense of the natural environment or the local culture. This highlights the importance of a strong ethical framework and a commitment to corporate social responsibility.
*   **Reinforcing Existing Power Structures:** While Blue Ocean Strategy has the potential to challenge existing power structures, it can also be used to reinforce them. For example, a dominant firm may use its resources and market power to create a blue ocean that further solidifies its position and makes it even more difficult for new entrants to compete.

**Conclusion:**

Blue Ocean Strategy is a powerful tool that can be used to create new markets and drive economic growth. However, its alignment with the commons is not automatic. To ensure a positive alignment, companies must adopt a conscious and deliberate approach that goes beyond the pursuit of profit. They must embrace the principles of value innovation for the common good, nondisruptive creation, and social inclusion. They must also be mindful of the potential risks of enclosure and exploitation, and be committed to managing their impact on the commons in a responsible and sustainable manner. Ultimately, the extent to which Blue Ocean Strategy contributes to the commons will depend on the values and intentions of those who wield it.
