Building movements that include people with different relationships to economic power requires maintaining sharp class analysis while creating genuine bridges across class locations, avoiding the tokenization of working-class people in professional-led spaces, and discovering shared analysis of mutual benefit.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)

### Section 1: Context

Movements and organizations attempting systemic change face a fragmentation crisis: those with economic security, formal education, and institutional access operate in separate ecosystems from those whose survival depends on immediate material conditions. In activist spaces, this manifests as movements led by credentialed professionals that recruit working-class people as foot soldiers rather than co-architects. In corporate and government contexts, this shows up as "diversity initiatives" that gather people across pay grades without shifting power or analysis. In tech, product teams designing for "users" remain predominantly drawn from a narrow class location, building systems that solve problems they don't experience. The vitality drain is real: movements fragment when class-location differences aren't named; organizations hollow out when cross-class participation becomes performative; and products fail because they're built by people insulated from the consequences of their choices. The ecosystem is stagnating precisely where it should be most adaptive—at the intersections where different material experiences could generate new understanding.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Cross vs. Building.**

The tension runs deep. **Cross** pulls toward rigorous class analysis—naming differences in material stakes, education access, decision-making power, and risk exposure. This clarity is essential: pretending class doesn't matter is itself a class position (usually the position of those with the luxury to ignore it). **Building** pulls toward coalition, toward the practical work of creating shared movement or organizational capacity that requires people to show up across difference. When class analysis becomes a sorting mechanism ("your consciousness isn't right"), alliances fracture. When building ignores class entirely ("we're all in this together"), decision-making gets captured by those with time and resources to dominate meetings. The system breaks at a specific point: working-class people bring irreplaceable knowledge about what actually happens on the ground, about survival strategies, about where leverage really sits. But if that knowledge is extracted rather than stewarded—if working-class people are asked to contribute labour without shaping direction—the alliance exhausts itself. Professional-led movements get better analysis but lose credibility and adaptive power. Working-class participants get burned out and leave. The whole effort decays from within.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, create structural roles where class-location differences are named as assets, design decision-making processes that require cross-class agreement to move forward, and establish material support systems that make participation possible across different economic conditions.**

This pattern works by shifting class difference from a liability to manage into an *epistemic asset*—a necessary condition for good thinking. A person whose children attend underfunded schools sees different solutions than someone whose children attend private schools. Someone working multiple service jobs understands timing, exhaustion, and survival calculation differently than someone with a single salaried role. Rather than asking these perspectives to be absorbed into a dominant framework, the pattern builds decisions that *require* them—not as advisory input, but as blocking power.

The mechanism is straightforward in living systems terms: no healthy ecosystem has a single processor. Cross-class alliance building establishes what we might call "parallel root systems"—different people bringing different sensing apparatus into shared soil. A campaign doesn't move forward until both the organizer with institutional connections *and* the single parent working retail have both said "yes, this works for my people." This creates friction, yes. It also creates resilience: decisions made through this friction are more likely to work across conditions, not just in the abstraction where professional strategists live.

The pattern draws from political economy's core insight: class isn't individual identity, it's relationship to material conditions and means of production. It draws from class analysis the practice of *naming* stakes explicitly—asking "what do you risk if this fails? What do you gain if it succeeds?"—rather than papering over difference with universal language. And it borrows from commons stewardship the principle that those most affected by a decision should have the most say in making it.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**For activists:** Establish a **leadership structure that requires cross-class representation in any decision-making body**—not as diversity checkboxes, but as mandatory diversity of economic location. A campaign steering committee includes both someone whose income comes from the campaign's organization and someone whose survival depends on keeping their primary job. Structure meetings with temporal justice: rotating meeting times so night-shift workers can attend; covering childcare and transit explicitly rather than assuming it; scheduling key decisions in short blocks rather than extended sessions that privilege those with flexible time. Crucially, **establish veto power**: a person can say "this strategy won't work for my class location" and that statement requires redesign, not persuasion. Pay hourly workers for strategic planning time—don't extract their thinking for free.

**For corporations:** Create **cross-grade product teams where frontline workers, middle managers, and executives co-design solutions**. A tech company building internal tools brings warehouse staff into the room with engineers—not for a single meeting, but as ongoing members who shape requirements, testing, and rollout. Make this structural: frontline workers' schedule and compensation adjust so they can participate fully; their input blocks deployment if they identify problems executives missed. A retail organization redesigning shift scheduling includes the cashiers and stockers whose lives are shaped by that schedule, with explicit authority to reject proposals that create cascading instability.

**For government:** Embed **participatory budget processes that require sign-off from both professional staff and affected residents**, with material support for resident participation (stipends for time, meetings at varied hours and locations, translation, childcare). A city agency redesigning services doesn't launch until both the deputy director and three people currently using the service have signed off. This isn't public comment; it's co-decision with binding power.

**For tech:** Hire **product researchers from the class locations you're building for**—not as user research subjects, but as permanent team members with veto power over feature release**. A gig-work platform includes a person currently doing gig work (compensated at their normal rate for research time) in every product decision. Make this structural: their economic location must be continuously renewed, not frozen at hiring. This prevents the slow drift where "we used to serve working-class people" becomes "we remember reading about them once."

Across all contexts: **Establish material equity**—if a professional organizer is paid $50/hour to think strategically, a working-class participant doing the same work is paid the same rate. Create explicit resource allocation so that building cross-class capacity isn't just volunteer love labour; it's stewarded with real investment.

---

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

New adaptive capacity emerges. Strategies designed through cross-class requirement fail less often because they've already been tested against reality—against the condition of someone who can't take an afternoon off, can't skip a paycheque, can't afford to lose their job if the campaign goes sideways. Movements and organizations develop deeper roots: people stay longer when they're stewarded as decision-makers, not conscripted as workers. Resilience increases in specific ways—the system can respond when conditions change because it has multiple sensing apparatus. Trust deepens unevenly but genuinely: when a working-class person sees their veto actually matter, not just in language but in decisions that shift, belief in the institution rises.

**What risks emerge:**

The pattern is **vulnerable to co-optation and hollow performance**. If cross-class participation becomes ceremonial—a person attends meetings but their input is systematically ignored—the pattern becomes a decay accelerant. People learn faster that their presence is extraction. Watch specifically for this: Do decisions *actually* shift when a working-class member voices concern, or is there a post-meeting reversal? The commons assessment scores reflect a real weakness here: resilience (3.0), ownership (3.0), and autonomy (3.0) all sit below the threshold. This pattern maintains health but doesn't *generate* new adaptive capacity. If implementation becomes routinized—"we have a working-class representative"—the pattern becomes rigid, a box-checking practice rather than a living relationship. The pattern also risks creating new inequity if material support isn't genuinely equitable. Paying some people for strategic time while assuming others volunteer creates new class dynamics within the coalition. Finally, watch for what the vitality reasoning flags: this pattern sustains but doesn't renew. Without active attention to *why* cross-class work matters, why analysis is sharp rather than soft, the pattern gradually empties.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**The Fight for 15 (2012–2019):** Fast-food workers, many undocumented and without stable housing, became co-strategists alongside experienced labor organizers and sympathetic economists. The pattern worked because decisions required agreement across class location: a tactic couldn't move forward if the workers most exposed to retaliation vetoed it. The wage demand itself ($15/hour) came from workers' calculation of their own survival needs, not from organizers' strategic assessment. The pattern decayed over time—as the fight professionalized, funding flowed to established nonprofits, and worker decision-making shifted toward advisory—but at its core, cross-class alliance building generated the most successful labor movement moment in a generation precisely because it maintained that structural requirement.

**The Highlander Center's Citizenship and Democracy Programs (1930s–present):** Highlander brings together rural working-class Southerners, often with minimal formal education, with intellectuals, organizers, and clergy across multiple campaigns. The structural practice: rotating who teaches (workers and intellectuals co-teach), material support for participation (room and board provided), and explicit decision-making authority for participants. Participants leave with sharpened analysis precisely because their experience was required to test and refine theory. The school has sustained across decades not through perfect practice but through continuous attention to whether cross-class learning is real or symbolic.

**Community Benefits Agreements (Bronx, Detroit, Chicago, 2000–present):** When developers proposed major projects, community organizations required that working-class residents and professional planners jointly design community benefit terms. The pattern held strongest where vetoing power was real: a neighborhood association could block development if their material concerns weren't addressed. Where it weakened (when agreements became advisory, when developer resources overwhelmed community capacity), participation became extraction—people showed up at meetings, nothing changed, they stopped coming. The pattern generated new vitality precisely when it maintained mutual veto.

---

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age of distributed intelligence and AI-assisted systems, cross-class alliance building faces new pressures and new opportunities.

The new risk: **AI systems can encode class bias at scale**. If a product team remains homogeneous in class location and uses AI to automate decisions, those class biases get replicated across millions of interactions—faster and more invisibly than before. A gig-work platform using algorithmic management can extract and exploit working-class participation in training data without ever centering their veto power. The tech context translation becomes urgent: teams building AI systems for working-class use *must* include working-class people in model design and testing, not just user research. This isn't nice; it's necessary.

The new leverage: **Distributed intelligence and decentralized systems can make cross-class decision-making architecturally easier**. Where traditional hierarchy required all decisions to flow through a single chain, blockchain-based or distributed governance structures can encode veto requirements—decisions require sign-off from nodes representing different class locations before execution. A platform cooperative can structure ownership and governance so that worker-members and consumer-members have mandatory co-decision on algorithmic changes that affect them. The pattern can shift from rhetorical ("we value your input") to systemic ("the code requires your authorization").

The new confusion: **"Diversity of AI" can masquerade as cross-class alliance building**. A company trains AI on data from multiple class locations and calls this "inclusive AI"—but the training data is extracted labour, and control remains consolidated. Real pattern-work requires that people from those class locations *govern* how AI is trained and deployed, not just provide the data.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

1. **Veto is used and respected**: A decision is actually redesigned when someone from a different class location blocks it. This happens visibly, not in closed meetings after the public one.

2. **Participation deepens over time**: The same working-class people return to meetings across quarters or years because they experience their input shifting outcomes. New people are recruited by peers, not top-down.

3. **Conflict is specific and named**: Disagreement happens as "this strategy won't work because of X material condition" rather than dissolving into abstract debate or personal tension. Class differences are discussed as such.

4. **Material support is normalized**: People are paid, childcare is covered, timing accommodates, and these arrangements are defended as non-negotiable infrastructure—not contingent on budget.

**Signs of decay:**

1. **Token participation**: The same people are invited to every meeting for optics, but their input is politely received and then ignored. Decisions shift only in language, not substance.

2. **Meeting inflation**: More meetings happen, taking more time, requiring more unpaid labour from those without schedule flexibility. Participation becomes impossible for working-class people even if they want it.

3. **Silence from working-class participants**: They stop offering input. The room is diverse but the conversation remains controlled by those with institutional experience. Veto power is unexercised because using it has costs.

4. **Professionalization of the struggle**: As the movement or organization grows, it hires more staff, raises more money, and decisions gradually shift to full-time professionals. Cross-class alliance remains in the mission statement but not the structure.

**When to replant:**

If you notice decay patterns emerging—especially token participation or decision-reversal—return to the material question: Are people paid? Can they attend? Is their actual veto power or advisory comfort? Replant when the pattern has become symbolic rather than structural. The right moment is often when someone explicitly names it: "This doesn't feel real anymore." That's the signal to rebuild the architecture.
