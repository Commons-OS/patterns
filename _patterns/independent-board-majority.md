# Independent Board Majority

### 1. Overview

The Independent Board Majority is a corporate governance pattern where the majority of a company's board of directors consists of independent, non-executive members. An independent director is a member of the board who does not have a material relationship with the company or its management. This pattern is a cornerstone of modern corporate governance, designed to ensure that the board can provide objective oversight and make decisions that are in the best long-term interests of the company and all its stakeholders, not just the executives or a dominant shareholder. The core purpose of this pattern is to mitigate conflicts of interest, enhance accountability, and bring a diversity of perspectives to the boardroom. By having a majority of independent directors, the board is better equipped to challenge management, scrutinize performance, and ensure the company is run in an ethical and responsible manner.

The problem this pattern solves is the potential for management to act in their own self-interest, rather than in the interest of the company and its shareholders. This can lead to a variety of issues, including excessive executive compensation, a lack of long-term strategic planning, and even corporate fraud. The origin of this pattern can be traced back to the corporate scandals of the early 2000s, such as Enron and WorldCom, which highlighted the dangers of having a board that is too closely aligned with management. In response to these scandals, regulatory bodies and stock exchanges around the world began to mandate or strongly recommend that a majority of board members be independent. This pattern is particularly relevant to commons-aligned value creation as it provides a mechanism for ensuring that the company is accountable to a broader range of stakeholders, not just its shareholders. By bringing in outside perspectives, an independent board can help to ensure that the company is considering its impact on the environment, its employees, and the communities in which it operates.

### 2. Core Principles

1.  **Objectivity and Impartiality:** The primary principle behind the Independent Board Majority pattern is to ensure that the board can make decisions with a high degree of objectivity and impartiality. Independent directors, by definition, are free from the conflicts of interest that can cloud the judgment of executive directors or those with close ties to the company.

2.  **Accountability:** An independent board is better equipped to hold management accountable for their performance. They can provide a more critical assessment of the company's strategy and operations, and are more likely to challenge management when necessary.

3.  **Stakeholder Representation:** While not a perfect solution, an independent board can provide a voice for a broader range of stakeholders, including employees, customers, and the community. This is because independent directors are not beholden to any particular interest group within the company.

4.  **Long-Term Perspective:** Independent directors are more likely to take a long-term view of the company's performance, as they are not under the same pressure as executive directors to deliver short-term results. This can help to ensure the long-term sustainability of the company.

5.  **Enhanced Credibility:** A board with a majority of independent directors is seen as more credible by investors, regulators, and the public. This can help to attract investment, improve the company's reputation, and reduce the risk of regulatory scrutiny.

### 3. Key Practices

1.  **Clear Definition of Independence:** It is crucial to have a clear and rigorous definition of what constitutes an independent director. This should go beyond the minimum legal requirements and should be tailored to the specific circumstances of the company.

2.  **Independent Nomination Committee:** The process for nominating and appointing new board members should be overseen by an independent nomination committee. This helps to ensure that new board members are truly independent and have the necessary skills and experience.

3.  **Regular Board Evaluations:** The board should conduct regular evaluations of its own performance, as well as the performance of individual directors. This can help to identify any issues with board dynamics or individual performance.

4.  **Executive Sessions:** The independent directors should meet regularly in executive sessions, without the presence of management. This provides a forum for open and frank discussion of sensitive issues.

5.  **Access to Independent Advisors:** The board should have the authority to hire its own independent advisors, such as lawyers and accountants, without having to go through management.

6.  **Term Limits:** Implementing term limits for board members can help to ensure a regular infusion of fresh perspectives and prevent the board from becoming too entrenched.

7.  **Diversity:** The board should be diverse in terms of gender, ethnicity, skills, and experience. This can help to bring a wider range of perspectives to the boardroom and improve decision-making.

### 4. Implementation

Implementing an Independent Board Majority requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. The first step is to establish a clear and robust definition of director independence that is appropriate for the company's specific context. This definition should be documented in the company's corporate governance guidelines and should be reviewed and updated on a regular basis. Once the definition of independence is established, the next step is to assess the current composition of the board and identify any gaps. This may involve recruiting new directors with specific skills or experience, or it may involve asking some existing directors to step down.

When recruiting new directors, it is important to have a transparent and objective process. This should be overseen by an independent nomination committee, which should be composed entirely of independent directors. The committee should develop a clear set of criteria for selecting new directors, and should conduct a thorough search to identify a diverse pool of qualified candidates. Once new directors are appointed, it is important to provide them with a comprehensive orientation to the company and the board. This should include information about the company's business, strategy, and financial performance, as well as its corporate governance policies and procedures.

Real-world examples of the successful implementation of this pattern can be found in many of the world's leading companies. For example, Microsoft has a board with a majority of independent directors, and the company is widely recognized for its strong corporate governance. Another example is Johnson & Johnson, which has a long history of having a strong and independent board. These companies have demonstrated that an Independent Board Majority can be a powerful tool for driving long-term value creation and ensuring the sustainability of the business.
