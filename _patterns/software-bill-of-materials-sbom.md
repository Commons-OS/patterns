### 1. Overview

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a pattern for building resilient value creation systems.

**Problem:** Modern software is not built, it is assembled. Applications are composed of hundreds of open-source and third-party components, which in turn have their own dependencies, creating a complex and often opaque software supply chain. When a new vulnerability is discovered in a common library (like Log4j), organizations struggle to answer a basic question: "Are we affected?" They have no easy way to know which of their applications use the vulnerable component.

**Context:** You are building or operating a software system and need to manage the risk inherent in your software supply chain. You need a formal, machine-readable inventory of all the components, libraries, and dependencies that make up your application.

### 2. Core Principles

**Generate and maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for your applications. An SBOM is a formal, machine-readable inventory of software components and their dependencies.** It is analogous to a list of ingredients on a food package.

An SBOM should include, for each component:
- **Component Name**
- **Component Version**
- **Supplier Name**
- **License Information**
- **Unique Identifier** (e.g., a PURL or CPE)

SBOMs can be generated by tools that scan source code, build artifacts, or container images. Once generated, they should be stored and used to:
- **Track Vulnerabilities**: When a new vulnerability is announced, you can query your SBOMs to immediately identify all affected applications.
- **Manage Licenses**: Ensure compliance with the licenses of all your dependencies.
- **Assess Supply Chain Risk**: Understand your exposure to risks from specific suppliers or components.

### 3. Rationale

An SBOM provides the transparency needed to manage a modern software supply chain. It:
- **Enables Rapid Vulnerability Response**: Turns a months-long manual investigation into a seconds-long database query.
- **Provides Foundational Transparency**: You can't secure what you don't know you have.
- **Is Becoming a Standard Practice**: Driven by government initiatives (like the U.S. Executive Order on Cybersecurity), SBOMs are becoming a standard requirement for software producers.

### 4. Consequences

- **Positive**:
    - A dramatic improvement in the ability to respond to supply chain vulnerabilities.
    - Increased transparency and trust between software producers and consumers.
    - A foundational component for a mature software supply chain security program.
- **Negative**:
    - **Tooling is still maturing**: The ecosystem of tools for generating, storing, and analyzing SBOMs is still evolving.
    - **Can be complex to generate**: Accurately generating a complete SBOM for a complex application can be challenging.
    - **It's not a silver bullet**: An SBOM tells you what you have; you still need other tools and processes to act on that information (e.g., vulnerability scanning and patching).

### 5. Application Context

**Best Used For:**
* Value creation systems requiring strong privacy and security foundations
* Organizations operating in regulated environments
* Systems handling sensitive data or requiring high trust

### 6. Known Uses

- **U.S. Federal Government**: The 2021 Executive Order on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity mandates that vendors providing software to the federal government must provide an SBOM.
- **CycloneDX and SPDX**: Two of the most common, open-source standards for the SBOM data format.
- **Software Composition Analysis (SCA) Tools**: Many commercial and open-source SCA tools can generate SBOMs.
