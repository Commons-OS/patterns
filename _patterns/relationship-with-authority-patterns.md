Recognizing personal patterns with authority—whether obedient, rebellious, triangulating, or genuinely autonomous—and understanding how these patterns emerged enables more intentional engagement with power.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Psychodynamic Theory, Systems Constellations.

### Section 1: Context

Most organizations and movements are ecosystems where power flows constantly—through decisions, resource allocation, voice, and presence. Yet the people stewarding these systems often operate on autopilot with authority itself, acting out patterns learned long before they entered the commons. A corporate manager defers to the executive above her the way she deferred to her father. A government employee sabotages initiatives from leadership because rebellion feels like autonomy. An activist organizer becomes authoritarian with volunteers, unconsciously recreating the very hierarchy they fight against. A technical team defaults to whoever speaks loudest in the meeting, regardless of whose idea has merit. 

These patterns are not character flaws—they are adaptive strategies encoded in the nervous system and reinforced by social conditioning. They emerge early, often invisible until they start fragmenting the system's capacity to learn and co-create. The living question is whether authority relationships can become conscious, intentional, and genuinely responsive rather than scripted. This happens only when individuals begin recognizing their own patterns and understanding the soil they grew from. Without this awareness, power dynamics calcify; with it, systems develop the flexibility to hold complexity and distribute decision-making vitally.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Relationship vs. Patterns.**

Every person has a relationship with authority—shaped by family, culture, trauma, and success. Simultaneously, every person carries patterns *about* authority that operate beneath conscious choice. The tension: real relationships require presence and responsiveness in the moment, but patterns pull toward repetition and self-protection.

When a practitioner encounters authority, three things can happen at once. The conscious mind tries to engage authentically: *I want to collaborate with this person. I want to contribute my ideas. I want to be trustworthy.* The pattern mind runs a script: *If I speak up, I'll be punished. If I obey perfectly, I'll be safe. If I rebel, I'll prove my worth. If I triangulate, I control the outcome.* The nervous system follows whichever signal is louder.

The fracture deepens across the system. A manager operating from obedience pattern cannot delegate—she recreates control structures below her. A leader running rebellion never stabilizes anything; the system stays in perpetual upheaval. An organizer caught in triangulation pits people against each other to maintain influence. A technical team's decisions become political theater rather than reasoned judgment.

What breaks: trust, continuity, the ability to hold disagreement without collapse, genuine accountability. The commons ossifies because people cannot metabolize feedback or correct course; they're too busy defending against old threats. The pattern is the real authority, not the human being choosing it.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, the practitioner learns to name their own pattern, trace its origins, and practice choosing different responses in live authority relationships.**

This pattern invites a shift from *being unconsciously shaped by authority relationships* to *consciously stewarding them*. The mechanism is recognition followed by cultivation of choice.

Psychodynamic theory names this as "transference"—the projection of past relationships onto present ones. Systems Constellations adds a crucial layer: patterns are not just psychological but systemic. They ripple through families, organizations, and movements across generations until someone in the system becomes aware and makes a different choice. That choice is not willpower; it is a re-rooting of the nervous system itself.

Here's how the pattern works: First, a practitioner identifies which pattern lives in their body. Am I obedient? Do I rebel against authority? Do I play people off each other? Do I actually choose autonomously? This is not intellectual—it is visceral. You feel it when authority enters the room. Your spine shifts. Your voice changes. Your thoughts narrow.

Second, they trace the origin. Where did this pattern germinate? In a parent's relationship with their boss? In a teacher who was cold or controlling? In a cultural narrative about power? This is not blame-seeking; it is archaeology. Understanding the logic of how the pattern once protected you creates compassion for it.

Third, they practice *responding differently* in real time with real authority figures. Not overnight transformation, but small, deliberate acts: speaking a true thing when obedience is pulling you silent. Pausing before rebelling. Staying present instead of triangulating. Each time you choose differently, you strengthen new neural pathways and begin to redistribute power more vitally through the system.

The vitality comes because this practice ripples. When one person in a system becomes conscious of their pattern with authority, it creates permission and pressure for others to do the same. The system develops immune function. It can hold complexity. It can correct course without collapse.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**In the corporate context**: A manager schedules a standalone conversation with their own supervisor (or a trusted peer) specifically to surface their authority pattern. They map it: *When feedback comes, I either collapse into compliance or I defend aggressively. I learned this from a critical parent.* They then identify one high-stakes decision coming in the next month where this pattern typically hijacks them. Before that decision, they meet with a colleague who knows the pattern and name it aloud: *I'm likely to be either over-deferential or over-assertive today. Call me if you see it.* They practice saying "I need to think about that" instead of auto-deciding, creating space for genuine choice. Over weeks, they notice decisions improving because they're not unconsciously choosing safety anymore.

**In the government context**: An agency team does a structured authority mapping session. Each person names: *What was the authority figure you learned from? How do you carry that into meetings with leadership? What happens to your voice?* A civil servant recognizes she silences herself in meetings with her director, exactly as she did with a dominating older sister. The next time her director solicits input, she prepares one true contribution beforehand and commits to naming it, even if her body wants to shrink. She fails the first time. The second time she speaks, briefly but clearly. By the third time, her voice has its own ground. Her contributions begin shaping actual policy direction.

**In the activist context**: An organizer notices they're replicating the hierarchical control they're fighting against. In a co-facilitation pair, they agree to explicit pattern-checking: *When I get anxious about outcomes, I tighten control. You'll see me interrupting people. Tell me, live.* They practice delegating actual authority (not just tasks) to newer members, even when this feels risky. They sit with the discomfort. They notice that when they're not in control, the movement develops deeper leadership and more resilient decision-making. They're not weakening—they're strengthening the commons.

**In the tech context**: A senior engineer realizes their pattern: they make final calls on architecture as a way of staying safe and significant. In a new project, they commit to a different practice: they map the decision-making clearly upfront, name where their voice matters and where it doesn't, and actively solicit dissenting views on technical choices. When someone disagrees, they pause the reflex to prove they're right and instead ask: *What am I missing?* The team's technical decisions improve because multiple perspectives actually shape them. The engineer's fear that delegation = irrelevance dissolves; they become more influential because more trusted.

**Across all contexts**: The core practice is a small group container—three to five people, recurring, confidential—where practitioners surface their patterns, notice them as they happen, and experiment with different responses. This is not therapy; it is commons practice. It normalizes that everyone has a pattern. It creates accountability without judgment. It seeds new possibilities into the system.

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

People begin to distinguish between their authentic presence and their protective patterns. Decision-making shifts from reactive to intentional. Feedback becomes metabolizable because it doesn't trigger the old armor. Trust deepens across the system because people's responses become more predictable and more genuine. Disagreement stops meaning threat; it becomes data. New capacity emerges as people stop defending their position and start genuinely problem-solving together. Authority relationships become clearer and more boundaried, which paradoxically makes collaboration more possible. The system develops richer feedback loops because people can actually hear what's being said instead of filtering it through their fear.

**What risks emerge:**

Without ongoing practice, the pattern reasserts itself under pressure. When systems get stressful or stakes get high, people default back to old scripts. There is also a risk of false consciousness—someone names their pattern but doesn't actually trace it to its roots; they intellectualize instead of transform. The pattern then goes underground and operates more subtly. Resilience remains low (3.0) because if the pattern isn't being actively tended, the system hasn't actually changed its structure; it's just temporarily aware. There's also a risk that practitioners weaponize pattern-naming—using it to shame others or excuse their own behavior. *Of course I acted that way; I have an obedience pattern.* Pattern awareness without choice is performative. Finally, if the containers where this work happens become insular, they can become their own kind of cult, valuing pattern talk over actual results.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**From Psychodynamic practice:** A therapist-turned-organizational-consultant worked with a Fortune 500 company's leadership team that was stuck in recurring conflict. The CEO had a strong obedience pattern (learned from a military father); underneath his confidence he deferred to board members even when he knew they were wrong. The CFO had a rebellion pattern; she automatically opposed the CEO's ideas as a way of maintaining autonomy. The pattern was: CEO defers, CFO opposes, nothing gets decided, everyone blames the other. The consultant facilitated a session where each leader named their pattern and its origin, in front of each other. The CEO spoke about his father for the first time in a professional setting. The CFO named her terror of losing autonomy. In the next quarter's decisions, something shifted. The CEO still consulted board members, but he spoke his own mind. The CFO still questioned proposals, but she asked genuine questions instead of opposing. The company made three major strategic decisions that had been stalled for two years. The vitality measure on engagement surveys went from 52% to 71%.

**From Systems Constellations work:** An activist collective in a worker-owned cooperative was fragmenting. The founder-facilitator was, ironically, running an authoritarian ship despite the collective's commitment to horizontality. She would triangulate—playing newer members against each other to maintain influence—then feel guilty and over-correct by abandoning all structure. The cycles exhausted everyone. In a constellation session (a specific family systems practice), the founder physically positioned representatives of "Authority," "Autonomy," and "Responsibility" in the room. As she moved and spoke, something in her body recognized: *I learned to manage my chaotic, alcoholic father through triangulation. I split people into allies and threats. I never felt safe unless I was orchestrating outcomes.* Seeing this pattern physically staged—not just intellectually—allowed her to feel it and then release it. She redesigned the decision-making structure with clear roles, clear consent processes, and explicit limits on her own authority. The collective stabilized. Members reported that for the first time, they could actually innovate together instead of managing the founder's anxiety.

**From tech practice:** A software engineering organization was experiencing chronic turnover in senior roles. A leadership coach noticed: every senior engineer who reported to the VP of Engineering eventually left. The VP had a pattern of triangulation—he'd praise engineers to their faces but complain about them to his peers. He'd tell them contradictory priorities based on who he'd spoken to most recently. Engineers had to guess what the real authority was. In a peer coaching group (organized around this pattern specifically), the VP named it: his family operated through coalition-building. You had to triangulate to survive. The moment he named it, he heard how exhausting it must be for his team. He made a radical choice: he moved all feedback to one-on-one meetings, where he told the truth directly. He stopped talking about his engineers behind their backs. He clarified his own authority and constraints clearly. Within a year, retention improved. More importantly, engineers began taking initiative instead of waiting for his triangulation to clarify what was actually wanted. Three of his team moved into leadership roles in other parts of the company—they had learned trust and autonomy from him.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age where AI systems are beginning to make and recommend decisions, and where distributed teams operate across time zones and cultures, authority patterns become *more* consequential, not less.

AI systems cannot recognize or adapt to human patterns with authority. A team member with an obedience pattern will over-trust an AI recommendation because it carries algorithmic authority. A rebellious member will reflexively distrust it. The system becomes more brittle, not less, because the human patterns now apply to inhuman actors. If a team is not conscious of its authority patterns, AI will amplify them: the obedient will abdicate responsibility to the algorithm; the rebellious will reject legitimate insights.

Conversely, teams that have done this pattern work become *more* capable of genuine human-AI collaboration. They can question AI outputs without either blind faith or knee-jerk rejection. They can distribute decisions—some to AI, some to human judgment, some to collaborative processes—with intentionality rather than fear. They can hold healthy skepticism.

There's also a new risk: pattern avoidance through delegation to AI. *Let the algorithm decide; then I don't have to face my authority anxiety.* This feels like progress but it's actually decay. The team atrophies the muscle of making value-laden decisions together.

The tech context translation becomes crucial: engineering teams need explicit, ongoing conversations about how their authority patterns shape which AI recommendations they trust, who gets to override the system, and how they distribute decision rights. Without this, AI becomes a tool for reproducing patterns at scale. With it, AI becomes a partner in distributed commons.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

People can name their pattern and laugh about it without shame. *I go into compliance mode; we all know it; here's where I'll probably freeze.* Conversations include explicit authority meta-commentary: *Is that your voice or your rebellion pattern?* People disagree without the system collapsing. When feedback comes, they can pause and ask *Is this their truth or my defensiveness?* rather than auto-responding. Decision-making accelerates because people aren't tangled in protecting their position relative to authority. You see new people stepping into leadership—not because they're the loudest, but because the system has actually made room for distributed agency.

**Signs of decay:**

Pattern-naming becomes performative: people talk about their patterns but keep acting them out. *I'm an obedient person,* someone says, then immediately defers on something important. The containers where this work happens become isolated from the actual work of the commons—a therapy pod disconnected from real decisions. People weaponize the pattern language: *That's just your rebellion pattern* becomes a way to dismiss inconvenient voices. Authority relationships harden again; people stop bringing their full selves. Decisions go back to being political theater. New members don't learn about the pattern work; it stays with the old guard. The system starts feeling exclusive and insular instead of alive and learning.

**When to replant:**

Restart or deepen this practice when you notice decisions becoming political again, when new voices stop emerging, or when people begin silencing themselves in meetings. The right moment is often triggered by a specific failure—a key person leaves, a crucial decision gets made badly, conflict that could be metabolized instead calcifies. That's when the permission and pressure to go deeper with this pattern work becomes real.
