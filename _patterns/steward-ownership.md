# Steward-Ownership

### 1. Overview

Steward-ownership is a model of corporate ownership that legally enshrines a company's social or environmental purpose, ensuring that it remains independent and mission-driven in the long term. The core purpose of this pattern is to separate economic and voting rights, which ensures that the company is controlled by stewards who are committed to its purpose, rather than by shareholders who may be focused on short-term financial gains. This structure is designed to solve the fundamental problem of shareholder primacy, where the legal duty to maximize shareholder returns can often conflict with a company's social or environmental mission. By placing control in the hands of stewards, this pattern allows a company to prioritize its purpose, reinvest profits back into the business, and create value for a broader set of stakeholders, including employees, customers, and the community.

The concept of steward-ownership has its roots in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with pioneers like Ernst Abbe of Carl Zeiss and Robert Bosch of Bosch, who transferred ownership of their companies to foundations to ensure their long-term independence and commitment to their respective missions. The term "steward-ownership" itself was more recently popularized by the Purpose Foundation, which has been instrumental in researching, defining, and promoting this model as a viable alternative to conventional, profit-maximizing ownership structures. Steward-ownership is deeply aligned with the principles of commons-aligned value creation, as it creates a corporate structure that is designed to serve a common purpose, rather than private interests. By ensuring that profits are reinvested to serve the company's mission, this pattern helps to build a more equitable and sustainable economy where businesses can be a force for good.

### 2. Core Principles

1.  **Purpose-Orientation:** The company is legally bound to serve a specific social or environmental purpose, which is enshrined in its governing documents. Profits are not an end in themselves but are a means to achieve the company's mission. This principle ensures that the company's activities are always aligned with its values and that it creates a positive impact on the world.

2.  **Self-Determination:** The company is independent and cannot be sold or taken over by outside interests. Voting control is held by stewards who are chosen for their commitment to the company's purpose and values. This principle protects the company from the pressures of the market and ensures that it can stay true to its mission over the long term.

3.  **Profits Serve Purpose:** All profits generated by the company are reinvested to support its mission, used to finance its growth, or donated to charitable causes. This principle prevents the extraction of value for personal gain and ensures that the company's financial success contributes to its social or environmental impact.

4.  **Stakeholder Governance:** The company is governed by a board of stewards that represents the interests of all stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, and the community. This principle ensures that the company is accountable to a broader set of interests than just those of its shareholders and that it operates in a way that is fair and equitable to all.

5.  **Mission-Locked Capital:** The capital invested in the company is "mission-locked," meaning that it cannot be withdrawn for personal gain. Investors receive a fair return on their investment, but they do not have control over the company or the right to sell their shares for a profit. This principle ensures that the company remains focused on its mission and that it is not driven by the need to generate short-term returns for investors.

### 3. Key Practices

1.  **Foundation Ownership:** The most common way to implement steward-ownership is to transfer a majority of the company's voting shares to a foundation that is legally bound to uphold the company's purpose. The foundation acts as a steward of the company, ensuring that it remains true to its mission and values.

2.  **Trust Ownership:** Similar to foundation ownership, this practice involves transferring ownership of the company to a trust that is managed by a board of trustees who are responsible for upholding the company's purpose. This is a common model in the UK and the US.

3.  **Veto-Share Structures:** In this model, a "veto share" is issued to a foundation or trust, which gives it the power to block any changes to the company's purpose or governance structure. This is a more flexible model that is often used by startups and smaller companies.

4.  **Golden Share:** A single "golden share" with special voting rights is held by a steward or a foundation. This share can be used to outvote all other shareholders on critical decisions, such as the sale of the company or a change in its mission.

5.  **Multi-Stakeholder Cooperatives:** In this model, the company is owned and controlled by its members, who can include employees, customers, and community members. This democratic structure ensures that the company is accountable to its stakeholders and that it operates in their best interests.

6.  **Perpetual Purpose Trust:** A legal structure that holds the company's shares in perpetuity and is legally bound to uphold its purpose. The trust is governed by a board of trustees who are chosen for their commitment to the company's mission.

### 4. Implementation

Implementing steward-ownership requires careful planning and legal expertise. The first step is to clearly define the company's purpose and to enshrine it in the company's governing documents. This may involve amending the company's articles of incorporation or creating a new legal entity, such as a foundation or a trust. The next step is to design a governance structure that will ensure the company remains true to its mission. This may involve creating a board of stewards with representatives from different stakeholder groups, or issuing a veto share to a foundation or trust. It is also important to develop a financing strategy that is aligned with the company's purpose. This may involve seeking out investors who are willing to accept a lower financial return in exchange for a social or environmental impact, or using alternative financing mechanisms, such as crowdfunding or revenue-sharing agreements.

One of the key considerations when implementing steward-ownership is the choice of legal structure. The best structure for a particular company will depend on a variety of factors, including its size, its industry, and the legal jurisdiction in which it operates. It is important to seek legal advice from a qualified professional who has experience with steward-ownership and other alternative ownership models. Another key consideration is the selection of stewards. The stewards will be responsible for upholding the company's purpose and for making key decisions about its future. It is important to choose stewards who are deeply committed to the company's mission and who have the skills and experience to guide it to success.

Real-world examples of steward-owned companies include Patagonia, which is owned by a trust that is dedicated to fighting climate change, and Bosch, which is owned by a foundation that supports a variety of charitable causes. These companies have demonstrated that it is possible to build a successful business while also making a positive impact on the world. Their success provides a powerful model for other companies that are looking to align their business with a higher purpose.

| Pillar       | Score (1-5) | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|--------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose      | 5           | The entire model is built around locking in and protecting a company's purpose. It is the central and most important aspect of steward-ownership.                                                                                                                              |
| Governance   | 5           | Governance is designed to serve the company's purpose, with control held by stewards who are committed to the mission. This is a significant departure from traditional governance models that prioritize shareholder returns.                                                |
| Culture      | 4           | Steward-ownership can foster a strong, purpose-driven culture, but it requires ongoing effort to ensure that the culture is aligned with the company's mission and values.                                                                                              |
| Incentives   | 4           | Incentives are aligned with the company's purpose, with profits being reinvested to support the mission. However, the lack of traditional financial incentives for founders and investors can be a challenge.                                                              |
| Knowledge    | 4           | Steward-owned companies are often committed to transparency and knowledge sharing, but there is no inherent mechanism in the model to ensure this.                                                                                                                            |
| Technology   | 3           | Technology is not a core focus of the steward-ownership model, but it can be used to support the company's mission and to enhance its social or environmental impact.                                                                                                     |
| Resilience   | 5           | The model is designed to create resilient companies that can weather economic downturns and other challenges. By locking in the company's purpose and protecting it from the pressures of the market, steward-ownership can help to ensure the company's long-term survival. |
| **Overall**  | **4.9**     | **Steward-ownership is a powerful model for creating purpose-driven companies that are built to last. It provides a robust framework for aligning a company's business with a higher purpose and for creating value for a broad set of stakeholders.**         |

### 6. When to Use

*   **Mission-Driven Startups:** For startups that are founded with a strong social or environmental mission, steward-ownership can be an ideal way to protect that mission from the pressures of the market.
*   **Family Businesses:** For family businesses that are looking for a succession plan that will ensure the long-term survival of the business and its values, steward-ownership can be an attractive alternative to selling the business or passing it on to family members who may not be interested in running it.
*   **Companies Seeking to Lock in Purpose:** For any company that wants to ensure that its purpose is protected in the long term, steward-ownership provides a legally robust way to do so.
*   **Social Enterprises:** For social enterprises that are looking for a way to scale their impact without compromising their mission, steward-ownership can provide a stable and supportive ownership structure.
*   **Businesses in for the Long Haul:** For businesses that are not interested in a quick exit and want to build a company that will last for generations, steward-ownership provides a framework for long-term thinking and planning.

### 7. Anti-Patterns and Gotchas

*   **Governance Theater:** It is important to ensure that the governance structure is not just a "paper exercise." The stewards must be actively engaged in the governance of the company and must have the power to hold the management team accountable.
*   **Lack of Founder Incentives:** The lack of traditional financial incentives for founders can be a challenge. It is important to find other ways to reward founders for their contributions, such as by providing them with a fair salary and a good working environment.
*   **Financing Challenges:** Steward-owned companies can face challenges when it comes to raising capital, as they are not able to offer investors the same kind of financial returns as traditional companies. It is important to seek out investors who are aligned with the company's mission and who are willing to accept a lower financial return.
*   **Cultural Misalignment:** It is important to ensure that the company's culture is aligned with its mission and values. This requires ongoing effort to build a culture of trust, transparency, and accountability.
*   **Legal Complexity:** The legal structures used to implement steward-ownership can be complex and expensive to set up. It is important to seek legal advice from a qualified professional who has experience with these models.
*   **The "Benevolent Dictator" Problem:** In some cases, the founder of a steward-owned company can become a "benevolent dictator" who is not accountable to anyone. It is important to have a strong governance structure in place to prevent this from happening.
