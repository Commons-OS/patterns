### 1. Overview

Open Source First is a pattern for building resilient value creation systems.

**Problem:** Building systems on proprietary, closed-source software creates vendor lock-in, reduces transparency, and can introduce unknown security risks. You are dependent on a single vendor for innovation, support, and security fixes. You have no ability to inspect the source code to audit its security or to modify it to meet your specific needs. This lack of control is a direct threat to digital sovereignty.

**Context:** You are making a technology choice for a new system or component. You need to select a solution that maximizes your control, flexibility, and long-term viability, while minimizing vendor lock-in and supply chain risk.

### 2. Core Principles

**Adopt an "Open Source First" policy, where open-source software is the default and preferred choice for all new technology decisions.** Proprietary software should only be chosen when a viable open-source alternative does not exist or cannot meet the requirements.

This is not just about using free software; it is a strategic decision to prioritize:
- **Transparency**: The ability to inspect the source code for security vulnerabilities and to understand how the software works.
- **Control**: The freedom to modify, extend, and fix the software yourself.
- **Community**: The ability to participate in a community of users and developers, which can provide support and drive innovation.
- **No Lock-in**: The ability to switch vendors or support providers without having to re-platform your entire system.

### 3. Rationale

An Open Source First strategy is a powerful way to build digital sovereignty. It:
- **Reduces Vendor Lock-in**: Gives you the freedom to choose and change your technology partners.
- **Increases Transparency and Trust**: Allows you to verify the security and quality of your software supply chain.
- **Fosters Innovation**: Allows you to leverage the collective innovation of a global community.
- **Lowers Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**: While open-source software is not always "free" (it requires investment in skills and support), it can significantly lower TCO by eliminating license fees.

### 4. Consequences

- **Positive**:
    - Increased control, flexibility, and sovereignty.
    - Reduced risk of vendor lock-in.
    - Access to a large community for support and innovation.
- **Negative**:
    - **Support Model**: You are responsible for your own support, or you need to contract with a third-party support provider.
    - **Skill Requirements**: Requires in-house expertise to manage, maintain, and potentially modify the software.
    - **Fragmentation**: The open-source ecosystem can be fragmented, with many different projects and competing solutions.

### 5. Application Context

**Best Used For:**
* Value creation systems requiring strong privacy and security foundations
* Organizations operating in regulated environments
* Systems handling sensitive data or requiring high trust

### 6. Known Uses

- **Governments**: Many governments around the world have adopted "Open Source First" or "Open by Default" policies for public sector IT.
- **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)**: The entire cloud-native ecosystem (Kubernetes, Prometheus, etc.) is built on open-source software.
- **Almost every modern technology company** builds its infrastructure and products on a foundation of open-source software.
