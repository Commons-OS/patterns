Periodically auditing satisfaction—what's working, what's not, what's missing—enables course correction before dissatisfaction becomes crisis.

> This pattern draws on Life Review, Reflection.

### Section 1: Context

Systems sustain themselves through periodic renewal. A commons stewarded by co-owners—whether a tech team shipping features, activists organizing campaigns, corporate leaders managing portfolios, or government officials serving communities—gradually accumulates friction. What felt aligned drifts. What once mattered fades. What needed addressing gets buried under urgency. The system continues functioning, but its vitality thins. Life Satisfaction Audit emerges in ecosystems where stewards recognize that drift compounds. It appears most visibly where:

- **Individuals carry co-ownership responsibility** without formal performance reviews to interrupt the drift (tech teams, activist collectives, executive cabinets).
- **Values and outcomes have decoupled quietly**—the work still gets done, but it no longer nourishes those doing it.
- **Seasons of intensity have created decision fatigue**—stewards haven't paused to ask whether the pace, direction, or relationships still serve the commons they're building.
- **Change is happening around the system** (market shifts, political cycles, movement evolution) and the steward hasn't updated their internal alignment.

This pattern typically surfaces in mature commons—ones stable enough to survive, restless enough to question. It's most urgent where stewards work without external accountability structures to force reflection. The activist collective, the founding team, the long-serving official—these are the humans for whom self-audit becomes a lifeline to coherence.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Life vs. Audit.**

Life demands presence, responsiveness, spontaneity. It resists freezing into categories. The moment you sit down to audit satisfaction, you step out of the flow you're trying to measure. The audit threatens to kill the aliveness it's meant to preserve.

Audit demands stillness, honesty, naming. It requires acknowledging what's broken, what's unfulfilling, what needs changing. Life doesn't want to hear this. Stewards avoid the audit because it surfaces what they've been managing through busyness: misalignment with collaborators, doubt about direction, exhaustion that hasn't been named.

The tension breaks real systems in three ways:

1. **Drift without correction**: Stewards skip the audit entirely. Satisfaction erodes silently. One day the activist realizes the campaign no longer serves the movement's deepest aim. The engineer notices she's shipping features she doesn't believe in. The official finds himself defending policies he can no longer stand behind. By then, the cost of course correction is high—relationships fractured, credibility spent, vitality consumed.

2. **Hollow auditing**: The steward conducts the audit—checks the box—but doesn't act on findings. Satisfaction scores are recorded. Nothing changes. The pattern becomes institutional theater. Trust in the stewards erodes because the audit revealed nothing was actually going to shift.

3. **Audit as weapon**: Poorly held audits become judgment sessions where stewards compare scores, shame gets weaponized, and the commons fragments into winners and failures. The audit's intent inverts. Instead of enabling course correction, it becomes a tool of hierarchy.

Without a pattern that honors both life and audit, stewards choose life—and the commons drifts toward crisis.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, establish a regular rhythm of structured reflection where each steward speaks their honest satisfaction against named dimensions of shared life, then holds findings lightly and acts on patterns, not metrics.**

The pattern works because it treats the audit as a living act, not a measurement event. Instead of asking "Is your satisfaction higher or lower?" (the audit kills life), it asks "Where is your energy flowing? Where is it draining? What's calling to you that we're not answering? What are we doing that no longer serves?" These questions don't freeze the moment—they illuminate it.

The mechanism operates in three movements:

**First: Create safety for honest naming.** Reflection traditions from contemplative practice to indigenous councils teach that truth emerges only when the space itself feels protected. The audit is not surveillance. It's not a report to leadership. It's held by the community of stewards as a commons practice—what gets named stays with us and moves us, together. The container is sacred not religious: confidential, non-hierarchical, structured around curiosity rather than judgment.

**Second: Audit against shared dimensions, not individual preferences.** Not "Are you happy?" but "Is our decision-making process serving the work?" "Are we stewarding resources the way we committed to?" "Are we honoring each other's time and gifts?" These frame satisfaction as a property of the system itself—relational, not personal. When a steward's satisfaction is low because the commons isn't functioning well, the audit names a shared problem to solve together.

**Third: Translate findings into micro-adjustments and bigger rethinks.** The audit isn't the destination—it's the seed for action. Some findings require immediate recalibration (we're meeting too often, drop back). Others require deeper redesign (our decision process doesn't actually include the voices we said it would). A few require honest reckoning (we've outgrown the original model; we need to dissolve this form or transform it). The pattern stays vital when the commons visibly changes based on what the audit reveals.

Life Review traditions recognize this: the point of reflection is not judgment but integration. The life auditor asks not "Did I live correctly?" but "What is this life trying to teach me? What adjustments let me live more truly?" Applied to commons stewarding, this yields audits that sustain vitality by keeping the system's nervous system awake.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

The Life Satisfaction Audit becomes real through a cultivated rhythm. Here's how practitioners anchor it in each context:

**Set a cadence that respects both depth and flow.** Annual audits are too sparse for agile systems (the activist campaign, the tech sprint cycle); quarterly audits can fracture a government team trying to implement long-term policy. Most commons find their rhythm at bi-annual or seasonal intervals—enough time for patterns to emerge, close enough to catch drift before it hardens. Name it on the calendar as sacred time. Protect it from being bumped. A tech team might anchor it to their ship cycle retrospectives; corporate leaders might tie it to fiscal quarters; activists might align with campaign phases; government teams might key it to budget or election cycles.

**Design the audit container as a listening ritual, not a survey.** Gather the core stewards in one room or circle—digitally if distributed, but synchronously. This isn't a Slack poll. Live presence creates the conditions for honest naming. Start with land acknowledgment, a moment of silence, or whatever invocation centers the community. A facilitator (rotating among stewards to distribute facilitation power) poses the core questions:

- What part of our shared work has been most alive for you since we last reflected?
- Where have you felt your energy drain? What's been heavy?
- What have we let drift that mattered to us when we started?
- What's one thing we should stop doing, one we should start, one we should deepen?
- Is our ownership structure still serving what we're trying to build, or does it need adjusting?

Each steward speaks their truth without interruption. No rebuttal. No problem-solving yet. Pure listening. This is where the audit differs radically from performance reviews. You're not building a case; you're creating shared map.

**For tech teams**: Add a technical satisfaction dimension: "Are we building in ways that still feel crafted? Are we shipping features we believe in, or optimizing for metrics that hollow out our purpose?" Record these alongside other findings. Many engineering teams discover through audits that they've drifted into velocity theater—shipping faster, feeling emptier.

**For corporate leaders**: Audit against fiduciary role and personal alignment. "Are we stewarding shareholder capital and stakeholder wellbeing in balance?" "Do the decisions we're making align with the values we recruited each other on?" Honest answers often surface conflicts between profit maximization and purpose. Name them. That's the point.

**For government officials**: Audit against accountability to constituencies and personal integrity. "Are we implementing policy we believe advances public good?" "Are we being heard by those affected?" "Does our decision-making reflect our commitment to equity, or have we drifted into bureaucratic convenience?" Government stewards often face acute tension between duty and doubt. The audit creates permission to name this without betraying the role.

**For activists**: Audit against movement alignment and personal energy. "Does this campaign still serve the liberation we're building? Are we burning people out? Are we actually reaching the communities we meant to?" Activist audits often surface whether tactical intensity is generating power or just consumption. They create space for stewards to name when a campaign has become performative.

**After listening, identify patterns, not outliers.** If one person says they're exhausted, that's data. If three people independently name exhaustion and you see it in the meeting room—heaviness, slower thinking, withdrawn energy—that's a pattern. Patterns point to what the system itself needs. Create a written synthesis: "What we're hearing," not "What [person] said." This keeps the audit systemic, not personal.

**Hold findings as diagnostic, not verdict.** The stewards aren't ranking themselves. They're reading the vital signs of the commons. Low satisfaction in decision-making? That's a signal the governance structure needs redesign. Excitement about the work but exhaustion from pace? That's a signal to renegotiate bandwidth or redistribute labor. The audit is diagnostic—it names what the system is showing us about itself.

**Close with commitment, not correction.** Don't force resolution in the audit moment. Sit with what's been named. Agree to convene within two weeks with specific proposal(s) for one micro-adjustment and one bigger exploration. Let the stewards digest. Often the insights that generate real change come in the days after, when the findings have settled.

---

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

The consistent practice generates new adaptive capacity. Stewards develop what practitioners call "system literacy"—the ability to read the commons's actual state beneath its surface functioning. They notice drift earlier, before it calcifies into crisis. They catch misalignment between stated values and real decisions before trust erodes. The audit also distributes power. In the absence of formal performance reviews and external accountability, the stewards use the audit to hold each other and themselves accountable to the shared commitments they made. This builds co-ownership muscle. Over time, stewards become less defensive about their roles and more curious about the system. They shift from "How am I doing?" (individual anxiety) to "How is *we* doing?" (collective resilience). That shift is profound.

Secondly, the audit ritual creates belonging. It says: this community takes its inner life seriously. What you feel, what you notice, what you're unsure about—these matter. This counters the toxicity that eats commons from inside: the feeling that one's authentic experience must be managed privately while the institution facade gets maintained publicly.

**What risks emerge:**

The pattern is vulnerable to three failure modes. **First, audit theater**: The stewards conduct audits on schedule but don't act on findings. Satisfaction scores accumulate in a document no one revisits. The audit becomes institutional hygiene, not renewal. This is especially dangerous because it inoculates stewards against trying again. They'll say "We did that audit thing and nothing changed, so why bother?" 

**Second, burnout acceleration**: Without strong norms about confidentiality and non-judgment, the audit becomes a space where stewards publicly shame each other or weaponize vulnerability. Someone names exhaustion and gets labeled a "commitment problem." Someone expresses doubt and gets isolated as insufficiently loyal. The audit that was supposed to create safety becomes another site of toxicity. This risks is high in hierarchical contexts where "satisfaction" gets coded as performance evaluation.

**Third, decision paralysis**: The audit surfaces genuine conflicts in what stewards want from the commons. One steward sees the work as urgent and necessary to continue; another sees it as past its useful life. Without skillful holding, the audit becomes the place where these conflicts erupt without resolution. The commons fragments.

The commons assessment flagged resilience at 3.0—the audit itself doesn't generate new adaptive capacity, it maintains existing function. This means the pattern is best paired with other practices that do generate novelty: regular experimentation, external input, emergent strategy sessions. An audit without capacity for actual change becomes a pressure valve that leaks off the energy that might fuel transformation.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**The Rockwood Leadership Institute's Life Review circles** (social justice leaders, 1990s onward) embedded regular life audits into their fellowships for emerging activists and organizers. Participants gathered quarterly in small groups with a trained facilitator to audit their inner and outer alignment: "Is the work you're doing aligned with your deepest commitments? Where are you being hollowed out? What needs to shift?" The ritual normalized the admission that organizing, despite its urgency, had costs. Participants could name exhaustion without shame. The result: many organizers who stayed in long-term movement work instead of burning out. Those who left did so with clarity, not breakdown. The pattern proved so vital that leadership development programs across the US now embed life audits as standard practice. The key insight: honest naming of dissatisfaction enabled stewards to make choices (pace down, role shift, leave) that actually sustained their service rather than consuming it.

**Mozilla's engineering retrospectives** (late 2010s) adapted the audit pattern specifically for distributed tech teams working on open-source and commercial products. Instead of only technical retros ("What shipped well? What broke?"), engineering leads added satisfaction audits: "Are we building the browser/security tool/protocol we believe in? Does our decision-making reflect the values we're stewarding?" One team discovered that while they were shipping features fast and the velocity looked good externally, they'd drifted into optimizing for engagement metrics they didn't believe ethically justified. The audit created permission to say this. It led to a renegotiation of what "success" meant and a shift in how they made tradeoff decisions. The team's velocity dipped slightly, but their vitality visibly increased—they were building something they could stand behind again. New engineers noticed the difference.

**The Highlander Center's staff audits** (ongoing, rural Tennessee, multiracial social justice hub) have long used structured life satisfaction audits to hold their co-learning model. Staff gather monthly to assess: "Are we living the values we're teaching? Are power dynamics we're supposed to have transformed actually transformed? Are we rotating leadership and decision-making, or are certain voices still dominating?" These audits are deliberately uncomfortable—they surface real hierarchy, real disagreements, real ways the institution hasn't lived up to its stated commitments. But they also create accountability without punishment. When an audit surfaces that a staff member has retreated from shared leadership, the response isn't discipline but curiosity: "What do you need from us so you can step back in?" The pattern has enabled Highlander to remain a vital commons for 85+ years by refusing to let its internal culture ossify.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

AI and distributed intelligence systems shift the Life Satisfaction Audit in profound ways. First, the risk: **automation of the audit itself**. It's tempting to imagine an AI system that periodically surveys stewards, aggregates satisfaction data, generates a report. This would be anti-pattern. The audit's power lives in the *relational act of witnessing and being witnessed*. An AI-mediated audit removes the presence that builds trust. Stewards will offer less honest data to a system than to a trusted human circle. The nuance, the subtext, the moment when someone's voice breaks—these carry information no survey captures.

Second, the opportunity: **AI as audit amplifier**. Post-audit, an AI system can synthesize patterns across multiple stewards' observations, surface contradictions in the collective sense-making, and suggest options for course correction. An AI trained on this commons's history can flag: "Three of the last four audits have surfaced decision-making slowness, but no structural change has been made. What's blocking?" This shifts the human work from information gathering to interpretation and judgment. The stewards can focus on the harder question: "Do we actually want to change this, or are we resigned to it?"

Third, the new pressure: **velocity and metrics drift**. In an AI-intensive environment, systems optimize, measure, and iterate at machine speed. Stewards become even more subject to drifting—the feedback loops happen so fast and at such volume that human satisfaction becomes invisible. The Life Satisfaction Audit becomes *more necessary*, not less, precisely because the default without it is systems that function perfectly while stewards burn out. The tech context translation—"Engineers audit satisfaction regularly"—becomes not optional but survival-critical in AI-heavy environments.

Fourth, a genuine risk: **AI as replacement for stewardship reflection**. If AI systems are making decisions, allocating resources, reshaping the commons's direction, stewards can devolve into passive monitors. The audit would need to explicitly include: "Are we actually deciding anymore, or are we ratifying machine-generated choices?" This is not metaphorical. It's an audit question for the next decade.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

- Stewards visibly *change behavior* following audits—not dramatically, but noticeably. A meeting gets cancelled because the audit surfaced overload. A decision-making process gets altered because the audit revealed unheard voices. The commons reads the findings as real, not ceremonial.
- Stewards *name hard things* in the audit without waiting for crisis. Dissatisfaction, doubt, misalignment—these surface early and can be addressed. The system's immune system is working.
- Between audits, stewards *reference the audit* in decision moments. "Remember we said we wanted to slow down? This timeline violates that." The audit becomes living guidance, not archived data.
- Participation and honesty *deepen over successive
