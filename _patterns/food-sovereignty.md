### 1. Overview

Food Sovereignty is a transformative framework that places the right of peoples to define their own food and agriculture systems at its center. It is the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods. This concept emerged in the mid-1990s as a response to the growing dominance of the corporate food regime, which prioritizes profits and market demands over the needs of people and the health of the planet. The core problem that Food Sovereignty seeks to solve is the disenfranchisement of small-scale food producers and consumers from the decisions that shape their food systems. The origin of the term can be traced back to the international peasant movement La Vía Campesina, which coined it in 1996. It has since been adopted and adapted by a wide range of social movements, Indigenous communities, and even some national governments, who see it as a pathway to a more just, sustainable, and resilient food future. The corporate food regime, characterized by industrial monocultures, long and opaque supply chains, and the concentration of power in the hands of a few multinational corporations, has led to a host of problems, including environmental degradation, the loss of biodiversity, the erosion of rural livelihoods, and the proliferation of unhealthy, processed foods. Food sovereignty offers a radical alternative to this destructive model, one that is based on the principles of democracy, justice, and sustainability.

### 2. Core Principles

Food sovereignty is built upon a foundation of seven core principles that collectively articulate a vision for a more just and sustainable food system. First and foremost, it **focuses on food for people**, asserting the right to sufficient, healthy, and culturally appropriate food for all as a fundamental human right, not merely a commodity for international trade. This principle challenges the logic of the global food market, which often treats food as a speculative asset, leading to price volatility and food insecurity. Secondly, it **values food providers**, recognizing and respecting the contributions of all those who cultivate, grow, harvest, and process food, while rejecting policies that threaten their livelihoods. This includes supporting small-scale farmers, who produce the majority of the world's food, but who are often the most marginalized and impoverished. Thirdly, it aims to **localize food systems**, bringing producers and consumers closer together and empowering them to make decisions about their own food. This includes protecting local markets from dumping and ensuring consumers have access to healthy, high-quality food. By shortening supply chains, localizing food systems can also reduce the carbon footprint of the food system and create more resilient local economies. Fourthly, it **puts control locally**, placing control over resources like land, water, and seeds in the hands of local communities. This principle is a direct challenge to the enclosure of the commons and the privatization of natural resources. Fifth, it **builds knowledge and skills**, drawing on the traditional knowledge of food providers and fostering research and innovation to support localized food systems. This includes valuing and protecting the traditional knowledge of Indigenous peoples, which has been developed over centuries of close observation of and interaction with their local ecosystems. Sixth, it **works with nature**, promoting agroecological production methods that are environmentally sustainable and resilient to climate change. This means moving away from industrial agriculture, with its heavy reliance on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, and towards a more holistic and ecological approach to farming. Finally, food sovereignty is about **food as a right, not a commodity**, and it seeks to create a food system that is based on the principles of social justice, solidarity, and cooperation.

### 3. Key Practices

The principles of food sovereignty are put into practice through a diverse array of strategies and initiatives. **Agroecological farming** is a cornerstone, employing ecological principles to create sustainable and resilient agroecosystems that minimize the use of external inputs. This includes a wide range of techniques, such as intercropping, cover cropping, agroforestry, and integrated pest management. This is complemented by the practice of **seed saving and exchange**, which empowers farmers to maintain control over their seeds, fostering crop diversity and local adaptation. Community seed banks and seed fairs are important institutions for promoting this practice. **Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA)** models create direct links between producers and consumers, providing farmers with a stable income and consumers with fresh, local food. In a typical CSA, consumers pay a subscription fee at the beginning of the season and in return receive a weekly share of the farm's harvest. **Farmers' markets and local food hubs** serve a similar purpose, providing a direct outlet for small-scale producers to sell their products. These alternative market channels can help farmers to capture a greater share of the value of their products and to build relationships with their customers. **Land reform and the defense of territories** are crucial for securing access to land for small-scale farmers and Indigenous communities. This can involve a range of strategies, from advocating for land redistribution policies to resisting land grabs by corporations and governments. **Participatory research and innovation** bring together farmers, researchers, and other stakeholders to co-create knowledge and technologies that are appropriate for local contexts. This approach challenges the top-down model of agricultural research and development, which often fails to address the needs of small-scale farmers. Finally, **policy advocacy and movement building** are essential for creating a supportive environment for food sovereignty and for challenging the power of the corporate food regime. This includes advocating for policies that support agroecology, protect local markets, and secure land rights for small-scale producers.

### 4. Application Context

Food sovereignty is best used for strengthening local food economies, empowering marginalized communities, promoting biodiversity, and enhancing community resilience. It is particularly relevant in contexts where the dominant food system has failed to provide adequate and nutritious food for all, and where there is a desire to build a more just and sustainable alternative. For example, in many countries of the Global South, food sovereignty movements are at the forefront of the struggle against hunger and poverty. It is not suitable for large-scale, industrialized agricultural systems focused solely on maximizing yield and profit. The principles of food sovereignty are fundamentally at odds with the logic of industrial agriculture, which treats nature as a machine and food as a commodity. The principles of food sovereignty can be applied across all scales, from the individual to the ecosystem, and in a variety of domains, including agriculture, health, and education. At the individual level, people can practice food sovereignty by growing their own food, buying from local farmers, and learning about where their food comes from. At the community level, people can organize CSAs, farmers' markets, and community gardens. At the national and international levels, people can advocate for policies that support food sovereignty. It is a versatile framework that can be adapted to a wide range of contexts, but it is most effective when it is driven by strong community organizations and social movements.

### 5. Implementation

Implementing food sovereignty requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses both practical and political challenges. Prerequisites for success include access to land and resources, a supportive policy environment, and strong community organizations. Without secure access to land, farmers cannot invest in long-term sustainable practices. Without a supportive policy environment, food sovereignty initiatives can be undermined by unfair competition from the corporate food system. And without strong community organizations, it is difficult to mobilize the collective action that is needed to build a new food system. Getting started can involve a range of activities, from forming a local food council to starting a community garden or advocating for supportive policies. A local food council can bring together all the stakeholders in the local food system to develop a shared vision and a common agenda for action. A community garden can be a powerful tool for teaching people about where their food comes from and for building community. And advocating for supportive policies, such as preferential purchasing for local and organic food by public institutions, can help to create a more level playing field for small-scale producers. Common challenges include competition from the corporate food system, lack of access to land and resources, and policy and legal barriers. The corporate food system has enormous economic and political power, and it will not give up its dominant position without a fight. In many countries, land ownership is highly concentrated, and small-scale farmers have to compete with large-scale agribusinesses for access to land. And many policies and regulations, from food safety laws to international trade agreements, are designed to favor the industrial food system. Overcoming these challenges requires strong social movements, strategic alliances, and a deep commitment to the principles of agroecology. Social movements can mobilize the collective power that is needed to challenge the status quo. Alliances with other social movements, such as the environmental movement and the labor movement, can help to build a broader and more powerful coalition for change. And agroecology provides the scientific and practical basis for building a food system that is both sustainable and just.

### 6. Evidence & Impact

The impact of food sovereignty can be seen in a growing number of initiatives around the world. Notable adopters include the international peasant movement La Vía Campesina, which has been at the forefront of the global food sovereignty movement for more than two decades. The government of Nepal has enshrined food sovereignty in its constitution, and other countries, such as Ecuador, Bolivia, and Senegal, have also taken steps to integrate food sovereignty into their national policies. The city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil, is a world-renowned example of how a city can use its purchasing power to support local farmers and to provide healthy and affordable food for its citizens. Documented outcomes include improved food security and nutrition, increased biodiversity, and greater community resilience. A growing body of research shows that agroecological farming systems can be just as productive as industrial agriculture, while also providing a wide range of environmental and social benefits. For example, a study by the University of Essex found that sustainable agriculture projects in 57 developing countries resulted in an average yield increase of 79%, while also improving water efficiency and carbon sequestration. The food sovereignty movement is also supported by a growing body of research, including the landmark International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD) report, which was sponsored by the World Bank and the United Nations and which concluded that a radical transformation of the global food system is needed. The report, which was written by over 400 scientists and development experts, called for a shift away from industrial agriculture and towards a more agroecological and locally-based approach to food and farming.

### 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

The cognitive era presents both opportunities and challenges for the food sovereignty movement. On the one hand, AI-powered tools have the potential to enhance agroecological practices and optimize local food distribution networks. For example, precision agriculture technologies can help farmers to apply water and nutrients more efficiently, while online platforms can connect farmers directly with consumers, cutting out the middlemen. On the other hand, there is also a risk that these technologies could be used to further concentrate power in the hands of a few. For example, the same technologies that can be used to support small-scale farmers can also be used by large corporations to monitor and control their supply chains. The challenge for the food sovereignty movement is to harness the power of the cognitive era to build more democratic, equitable, and sustainable food systems, while ensuring that the human element remains at the center of the food system. This will require a critical and discerning approach to technology, one that is guided by the principles of food sovereignty. It will also require a commitment to developing and promoting open-source technologies that are accessible to all, rather than proprietary technologies that are controlled by a few. The goal should be to use technology to empower people, not to replace them.

### 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

Food sovereignty is highly aligned with the principles of the commons. It is exemplary in its stakeholder mapping, its multi-dimensional approach to value creation, and its emphasis on shared rights and responsibilities. It explicitly recognizes a wide range of stakeholders, including those who are often marginalized in the dominant food system, and it seeks to empower them to collectively govern their food systems. It creates a wide range of value, from the economic value of local livelihoods to the social value of community and the ecological value of biodiversity. And it is based on the principle of shared rights and responsibilities, calling for a radical redistribution of rights over food and agricultural resources. It is a systemic approach that can be composed with other commons-based patterns, and its principles are fractal, meaning they can be applied at all scales. For example, it can be combined with the pattern of platform cooperativism to create online marketplaces that are owned and controlled by their users. And its principles can be applied at the household level, the community level, the national level, and the global level. While it faces many challenges in its implementation, food sovereignty offers a powerful framework for building a more just and sustainable food system. For these reasons, it receives a commons alignment score of 4 out of 5. The reason it does not receive a 5 is that it is still a work in progress. The food sovereignty movement has made great strides in recent years, but it still has a long way to go to achieve its vision of a world where everyone has access to healthy and culturally appropriate food, and where the people who produce our food are treated with dignity and respect.
