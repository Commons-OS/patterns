# FF025: Pre-Money vs. Post-Money Valuation

### 1. Overview

Pre-money and post-money valuation are fundamental concepts in the world of startup finance, providing a framework for determining the value of a company before and after a round of investment. The **pre-money valuation** refers to the value of a company *before* it receives external funding, while the **post-money valuation** is the value of the company *after* the investment has been made. The relationship between the two is simple: Post-Money Valuation = Pre-Money Valuation + Investment Amount. These valuations are not just abstract numbers; they are critical for negotiating the terms of an investment and for calculating the ownership stake that an investor will receive in exchange for their capital. The core purpose of this pattern is to establish a clear and mutually agreed-upon valuation for a company, which in turn determines the price per share and the resulting equity distribution. This clarity is essential for both founders and investors to understand the impact of the financing round on the company's ownership structure.

The problem that this pattern solves is the inherent ambiguity and potential for misunderstanding when a company raises capital. Without a clear distinction between pre-money and post-money valuation, there can be confusion about how much ownership an investor is actually purchasing. This can lead to disputes and a breakdown in trust between founders and investors. The concept was developed and popularized within the venture capital industry as a standardized way to structure investment deals. It has since become a ubiquitous part of the startup funding landscape, used in everything from early-seed rounds to late-stage growth equity financings. By providing a common language and a clear mathematical framework, the pre-money vs. post-money valuation pattern helps to streamline the negotiation process and ensure that all parties have a shared understanding of the deal.

In the context of commons-aligned value creation, the pre-money vs. post-money valuation pattern can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it is a tool of traditional venture capital, which is often focused on maximizing financial returns for a small group of investors. This can be at odds with the principles of commons-based peer production, which emphasizes broad-based participation and the creation of shared resources. On the other hand, a clear understanding of valuation and ownership is essential for any organization that needs to raise capital, including those that are committed to a commons-aligned mission. By using this pattern in a transparent and equitable way, commons-oriented startups can attract the resources they need to grow while also protecting their values and their community. The key is to use the valuation process as an opportunity to align the interests of all stakeholders, including founders, investors, employees, and users.

### 2. Core Principles

1.  **Valuation is a negotiation, not a science.** There is no single, objective way to determine the value of an early-stage startup. The pre-money valuation is ultimately a negotiated figure that reflects the company's traction, the market opportunity, the strength of the team, and the overall supply and demand for capital.
2.  **Clarity and transparency are paramount.** The pre-money vs. post-money valuation pattern is designed to bring clarity to the fundraising process. It is essential that all parties have a shared understanding of the valuation and how it will impact the company's ownership structure.
3.  **The option pool is a key component of the pre-money valuation.** The size of the employee stock option pool (ESOP) is a critical part of the pre-money valuation negotiation. Investors will typically want to ensure that there is a large enough option pool to attract and retain top talent, and this will be factored into the pre-money valuation.
4.  **Dilution is a natural consequence of fundraising.** Every time a company raises capital, the ownership stake of the existing shareholders is diluted. The pre-money vs. post-money valuation pattern provides a clear framework for calculating and understanding this dilution.
5.  **The post-money valuation reflects the company's potential.** The post-money valuation is not just a reflection of the company's current value; it is also a bet on its future potential. Investors are willing to pay a premium for companies that they believe have the potential to generate significant returns.
6.  **Alignment of interests is the ultimate goal.** The valuation process should be seen as an opportunity to align the interests of all stakeholders. By creating a fair and transparent ownership structure, companies can build a strong foundation for long-term success.

### 3. Key Practices

1.  **Build a strong fundraising narrative.** Before you even start talking to investors, you need to have a compelling story about your company and its potential. This narrative should be supported by data and a clear vision for the future.
2.  **Do your homework on comparable companies.** Research recent funding rounds for companies in your space to get a sense of typical valuations. This will help you to set a realistic valuation range for your own company.
3.  **Create a detailed financial model.** A well-built financial model is essential for justifying your valuation and for showing investors how you plan to use their capital to grow the business.
4.  **Negotiate the pre-money valuation, not the post-money valuation.** The pre-money valuation is the key lever in the negotiation process. By focusing on the pre-money valuation, you can have a more productive conversation with investors about the value of your company.
5.  **Be clear about the size of the option pool.** The size of the option pool should be explicitly discussed and agreed upon as part of the pre-money valuation negotiation.
6.  **Model out the cap table for different valuation scenarios.** Use a cap table management tool to model out the impact of different valuation scenarios on the company's ownership structure. This will help you to understand the trade-offs between different valuation levels.
7.  **Communicate openly and honestly with your investors.** The fundraising process is a two-way street. Be prepared to answer tough questions from investors and to be transparent about the risks and challenges facing your business.
8.  **Get everything in writing.** Once you have reached an agreement with an investor, make sure that all of the terms of the deal are clearly documented in a term sheet and in the final legal documents.

### 4. Implementation

Implementing the pre-money vs. post-money valuation pattern is a multi-step process that requires careful planning and execution. The first step is to develop a strong fundraising narrative and a detailed financial model. This will be the foundation for your valuation discussions with investors. Once you have a clear sense of your company's value proposition and financial projections, you can start to research comparable companies and recent funding rounds in your space. This will help you to establish a realistic valuation range for your company. With this information in hand, you can begin to have conversations with potential investors. The goal of these conversations is to find an investor who shares your vision for the company and who is willing to invest at a valuation that is fair to all parties.

The negotiation process itself is a delicate dance. It is important to be confident in your valuation, but also to be open to feedback from investors. The key is to focus on the pre-money valuation and to be clear about the size of the option pool. By modeling out different valuation scenarios, you can understand the impact of the financing round on your ownership stake and make an informed decision about whether to accept an investor's offer. Once you have reached an agreement, it is essential to get everything in writing. The term sheet will outline the key terms of the deal, and the final legal documents will make it official. Throughout the entire process, it is important to communicate openly and honestly with your investors. Building a strong relationship based on trust and transparency is essential for long-term success.

For example, imagine a startup that is raising a $2 million seed round. The founders and the investors agree on a pre-money valuation of $8 million. This means that the post-money valuation will be $10 million ($8 million pre-money + $2 million investment). The investors will receive a 20% ownership stake in the company ($2 million investment / $10 million post-money valuation). The founders, who previously owned 100% of the company, will now own 80% of the company. This is a simplified example, but it illustrates the basic mechanics of the pre-money vs. post-money valuation pattern. In the real world, there are many other factors that can come into play, such as the option pool, liquidation preferences, and anti-dilution provisions. However, the basic principle remains the same: the pre-money vs. post-money valuation pattern provides a clear and transparent framework for determining the ownership structure of a company after a round of financing.

### 5. 7 Pillars Assessment

| Pillar | Score (1-5) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | 3 | The pattern is a tool for capitalization, which can be used for any purpose, including commons-aligned ones. However, it is most commonly associated with the venture capital model, which is not always aligned with the commons. |
| Governance | 2 | The pattern itself does not prescribe a particular governance model. However, it is often used in a way that concentrates power in the hands of investors, which can be detrimental to commons-based governance. |
| Culture | 2 | The pattern can create a culture of financialization and exit-orientation, which can be at odds with the values of a commons-oriented community. |
| Incentives | 3 | The pattern can be used to create incentives for all stakeholders, including employees and users. However, it is often used to create incentives that are primarily financial in nature. |
| Knowledge | 4 | The pattern is a well-documented and widely understood concept in the world of startup finance. This makes it accessible to a broad range of people, which is a key principle of the commons. |
| Technology | N/A | The pattern is a financial and legal concept, not a technology. |
| Resilience | 3 | The pattern can help to make a company more resilient by providing it with the capital it needs to grow. However, it can also make a company more vulnerable to the whims of the market and the demands of investors. |
| **Overall** | **2.8** | **The pre-money vs. post-money valuation pattern is a powerful tool for capitalizing a startup, but it is not inherently aligned with the commons. It can be used in a way that supports a commons-aligned mission, but it can also be used in a way that undermines it. The key is to be intentional about how the pattern is used and to prioritize the values of the commons throughout the fundraising process.** |

### 6. When to Use

*   When raising capital from external investors, such as angel investors or venture capitalists.
*   When you need to establish a clear and mutually agreed-upon valuation for your company.
*   When you want to understand the impact of a financing round on your company's ownership structure.
*   When you are negotiating the terms of an investment, such as the price per share and the size of the option pool.
*   When you are communicating with your team and other stakeholders about the company's valuation and ownership.
*   When you are creating a cap table to track the ownership of your company over time.

### 7. Anti-Patterns and Gotchas

*   **Focusing too much on valuation.** While valuation is important, it is not the only thing that matters. It is more important to find an investor who shares your vision and who can add value to your company beyond just their capital.
*   **Giving up too much equity too early.** Be careful not to give up too much of your company in the early stages. It is important to retain enough ownership to stay motivated and to be able to raise future rounds of financing.
*   **Not understanding the terms of the deal.** The term sheet can be a complex legal document. Make sure you understand all of the terms of the deal before you sign it. It is always a good idea to have a lawyer review the term sheet before you sign it.
*   **Not being transparent with your investors.** Trust is the foundation of a good investor relationship. Be open and honest with your investors about the good, the bad, and the ugly.
*   **Not having a clear plan for how you will use the investment.** Investors want to see that you have a clear plan for how you will use their capital to grow the business. Make sure you have a detailed financial model and a clear set of milestones that you plan to achieve.
*   **Getting caught up in the hype.** It is easy to get caught up in the hype of the fundraising process. Stay grounded and focused on building a great business.
