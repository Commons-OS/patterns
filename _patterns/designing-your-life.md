  Life Design — pioneered by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans at Stanford —
  applies design thinking principles to life planning: prototyping,
  wayfinding, and reframing rather than optimising toward a single
  predetermined goal. This pattern covers the core Life Design moves:
  gravity problems vs. anchor problems, the workview/lifeview
  integration, and the practice of building and testing multiple
  possible lives rather than searching for a single 'right' path.

Life Design applies design thinking principles to life planning, replacing the myth of one right path with the practice of prototyping multiple possible futures.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Burnett & Evans / Design Thinking.

### Section 1: Context

Most knowledge workers—especially those in their 20s through early 40s—operate in a system that demands they choose a single narrative early and optimise relentlessly toward it. Career ladders assume linearity. Educational trajectories assume specialisation. Life planning assumes clarity of purpose from the start. Yet the actual ecosystem is fragmented: professional identity fractures across multiple roles (employee, freelancer, parent, community member), economic stability erodes predictably, and the skills that secured yesterday's path often obsolete tomorrow's. The system is stagnating because the feedback loop is broken—people don't get to test whether their chosen path actually feeds their energy until years in, when course correction becomes painful. In corporate settings, this surfaces as mid-career crisis or quiet quitting. In government, it creates burnout in public servants locked into rigid role definitions. Activist communities lose talented people who cannot reconcile vocation with survival. Tech product managers especially feel the pressure: the culture valorises a singular climb toward VP-level influence, leaving lateral moves and sabbaticals treated as failure. The pattern arises because practitioners need a framework that permits real exploration *while living*, not after retirement.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Gravity Problems vs. Anchor Problems.**

A **Gravity Problem** is a constraint that will not yield to willpower or positive thinking: you have dependents, chronic illness, geography, debt, or biology that genuinely limits your options. These are real. Ignoring them produces burnout or collapse.

An **Anchor Problem** is a belief you hold about yourself—"I must become partner by 35," "I'm not a creative person," "I should know what I want"—that feels immovable but is actually constructed. These are real *too*, but they are malleable.

The tension breaks systems when practitioners conflate them. Someone with a mortgage (gravity) decides this means they can never explore a lower-income vocation (often just a reframed anchor problem). A public servant with caring responsibilities (gravity) believes this mandates accepting a soul-crushing role (actually an anchor about duty). A product manager with student debt (gravity) accepts that they must climb toward maximum salary alone (anchor disguised as necessity).

The fracture deepens because most planning methodologies treat everything as gravity and demand optimisation. "What's your five-year goal?" assumes you already know your constraints and your values—and that they're stable. This collapses the distinction. People either give up on honest self-knowledge and simply follow the path of least resistance, or they sacrifice wellbeing chasing an anchor problem they've mistaken for destiny.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, practitioners design and test multiple possible lives in parallel, distinguishing gravity problems from anchor problems, and using rapid prototyping cycles to learn which futures actually fit.**

This shift moves life planning from a prediction problem (forecasting the "right" path) to a learning problem (building confidence in which futures energise you). The mechanism works through three integrated moves:

**First, the Workview/Lifeview integration.** You name your actual beliefs about what work *is* (Is it service? Craft? Survival? Meaning-making?) and what life *is* (Is it family? Growth? Pleasure? Contribution?). Then you look at the gap. Most people have never articulated these simultaneously. The gap itself is fertile: it's where you find what's actually negotiable. A civil servant might discover their workview prizes justice and impact, while their lifeview prioritises presence with family. Not irreconcilable—but it requires different choices than a role that demands 60-hour weeks.

**Second, prototyping lives rather than choosing one.** Instead of deciding, you build three credible futures: the Life You're Currently On (the baseline), a Life That's Radically Different (stretching anchor problems), and a Life That Emerges from Curiosity (following signals without judgment). Then you test each through small, low-cost experiments. Curious about a different career? Don't quit—spend three months doing small projects in that domain. Testing a different location? Spend a summer there, not just a weekend. The prototype produces real data about fit, not just fantasy.

**Third, gravity/anchor distinction as a navigation tool.** When stuck, you ask: Is this constraint external and immovable (gravity), or is it a belief I've adopted (anchor)? Gravity problems demand creative accommodation, not denial. Anchor problems deserve to be challenged, tested, and sometimes dissolved. A person with severe health constraints (gravity) might design a life around remote work and controlled pace (accommodation), not attempt to become a field researcher. A person who believes "I'm not analytical enough for tech" (anchor) might do a three-month coding bootcamp prototype and discover otherwise.

The system stays vital because it cycles continuously: prototype, extract learning, adjust workview/lifeview, prototype again. It's not a plan you execute—it's a living practice of intimate experimentation.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**Move 1: Map your current workview and lifeview.**

In a quiet session (90 minutes), write two short essays without editing: one on what work means to you (Why should anyone work at all? What makes work worth doing? What does good work feel like?), one on what life means (What makes a life well-lived? What matters most to you? What are you afraid of?). Read them aloud to someone you trust or record yourself. Listen for contradictions, surprises, language that feels true.

**In corporate settings**, frame this as your "Career Purpose Statement" and do it with your manager or an executive coach. Many Career Architecture Programs start here—you're naming the values underneath the title, which often reveals that the next rung on the ladder doesn't actually serve your workview.

**In government**, this is "Public Service Covenant"—what drew you to public service, and what life do you actually want to hold alongside it? Civil servants often discover their workview centres on equity and systemic change, but their current role locks them into compliance. The gap is actionable.

**For activists**, call it "Vocation Mapping"—the explicit work of naming how your livelihood and your movement align or conflict. Many burn out not from the cause but from the mismatch between what the cause requires and what sustains their life.

**In tech**, product managers often skip this. Add it as "Product Philosophy" and "Life Philosophy"—what do you actually believe about building, and what does a sustainable career look like for you? This surfaces whether you're climbing toward power or crafting toward meaning.

**Move 2: Build three credible futures.**

For each of the three lives (Current, Radical, Curiosity), write a one-page narrative set 5 years forward in present tense. What's a typical Tuesday? Who's in your life? What matters daily? What's hard? Don't fantasise—make it realistic enough that someone could actually live it. Include work, relationships, location, pace, what you're learning.

Share these with a trusted peer or mentor. Ask: "Does this feel real? What would make it more real?"

**Move 3: Design small prototypes for each future.**

For the current life: What experiment would deepen or test your commitment to your present path? (Shadow someone in your role five years ahead; take on a bigger project; talk to people who've stayed.)

For the radical life: What's the smallest, lowest-cost way to test it? (Three months of weekends in a different domain; a conversation with someone living it; a skills trial.)

For the curiosity life: What signal are you following? Design a 4–6 week prototype that lets you gather real data. (Not a career change—a dedicated project, volunteer role, or learning cycle.)

**Move 4: Extract and iterate.**

After each prototype cycle (4–8 weeks), gather with your peer group or mentor. What did you learn about fit, energy, constraints, and what's actually negotiable? Did any anchor problems dissolve? Did gravity problems reveal creative accommodation? Update your workview/lifeview. Redesign the next cycle of prototypes based on what you learned.

**In all contexts**, this is not a one-time exercise. It's a quarterly or biannual practice. The lives you're testing should stay slightly unstable, always responsive to what you're learning about yourself and the actual ecosystem around you.

---

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

This pattern generates *permission*—practitioners stop treating life as a fixed choice and start treating it as an evolving design. Energy returns. People report feeling simultaneously more grounded (because they've tested their assumptions) and more open (because they've given up the myth of one right answer). New relationships form: peers who are also prototyping become allies rather than competitors. Career transitions become less catastrophic when they're framed as evolved design rather than failure.

Workplaces that adopt this practice see reduced attrition in talented people and lower burnout—not because conditions improve, but because people are making clearer choices aligned with their actual values. Government agencies using this model report stronger retention of mission-driven staff. Tech teams with product managers who've done this design work build products more grounded in real human rhythm, not just growth curves.

**What risks emerge:**

The primary risk is *routinisation into hollow practice*. If implementation becomes a box-checking exercise—an annual offsite where people fill out worksheets but never actually prototype—the pattern becomes performative and the system atrophies. The commons assessment score for resilience (3.0) reflects this: designing your life creates continuity and wellbeing maintenance, but it doesn't necessarily generate new adaptive capacity or build the system's ability to handle genuine disruption.

A second risk: *anchor problems misdiagnosed as gravity*. Someone might use this framework to rationalise staying in harmful situations ("this is just my gravity problem") rather than testing whether the constraint is actually malleable. Without a trusted witness asking hard questions, the pattern can become a permission structure for stagnation rather than growth.

Third, *prototype fatigue*. If you're always testing, always iterating, you never actually *live* a life long enough to know its texture. Some practitioners get caught in perpetual prototyping mode, confusing exploration with commitment. The pattern works only if it produces moments of genuine choice and settlement, not endless deferral.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Bill Burnett and Dave Evans at Stanford (2007–present).** The pattern originated in their course "Designing Your Life," later formalised in the book by the same name. They worked with hundreds of Stanford students and professionals. A characteristic story: a student convinced she had to become a doctor (anchor problem masked as family expectation and personal belief) designed three lives. One was the "path to medical school." One was becoming a science communicator. One was exploring what drew her to healing work specifically. Her prototype for the third life—volunteering as a health educator in community clinics—revealed that the appeal was teaching and relationships, not medical science. She shifted to a Master's in Public Health with a teaching focus, which aligned her workview (helping people understand their own health) with her lifeview (presence, teaching, sustainable pace). The design framing made a major pivot feel like evolution, not failure.

**A mid-career tech product manager (unnamed, but representative of dozens of cases at major tech firms).** She'd climbed to Senior PM at a FAANG company but felt hollow. Using the design framework, she named her workview (building products that mattered, learning from real users) and lifeview (parenting two young children, creative expression). The gap was clear: the role demanded constant urgency and travel that contradicted her lifeview. Rather than quit abruptly, she prototyped: took a leave, spent three months freelance advising early-stage startups with flexible hours. The prototype revealed she could satisfy her workview at much smaller scale and with far more autonomy. She transitioned to working with nonprofits and early-stage companies, sometimes as consultant, sometimes as embedded PM. Her gravity problems (need for income, professional respect) remained. Her anchor problems (belief that impact required climbing at big tech) dissolved.

**A UK civil servant (government context).** Trapped in a Tier 2 compliance role that drained her, she used the framework to surface that her workview was about systemic change and her lifeview centred on close relationships and time for community organising. Her current life looked like: 50-hour weeks in a desk role, commuting 90 minutes each way, no energy for the grassroots work she cared about. She built two alternatives: one was leaving government entirely (radical life). One was exploring roles in policy design or community liaison within government (curiosity life). She prototyped the curiosity life by volunteering to lead a cross-departmental task force on community input. That prototype led to a transfer into a policy design role with different rhythms. Her gravity problem (need for job security, pension) was accommodated within a new architecture. Her anchor problems (belief that real change couldn't happen inside government) began to shift.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age of AI and distributed intelligence, this pattern amplifies and transforms in three ways:

**First, prototyping accelerates.** AI tools can help you rapidly model what a future life might look like by generating scenarios, financial projections, or schedule simulations. A product manager curious about leaving tech can use an AI tool to model three years of freelance income, childcare rhythms, and learning time more precisely than guessing. The prototype becomes more credible and faster to run. The risk: practitioners mistake simulation for lived experience and confuse data-rich scenarios with actual fit.

**Second, the workview/lifeview conversation deepens because AI makes visible what we've always believed but never articulated.** If you're designing a career in product management and you're training an AI model or working alongside an LLM, you surface what you actually value in the work (Is it persuasion? Clarity? User empathy? Shipping?) versus what you thought you valued. This clarifies anchor problems faster. An activist designer using AI to manage campaign logistics realises the work she actually does—emotional labour, relationship maintenance—isn't automated and never will be. That insight reframes her whole vocation.

**Third, and most challenging: AI introduces a new gravity problem.** If systems are replacing knowledge work, career paths that seemed stable (tech, professional services, government analysis) become unstable in new ways. Prototyping becomes more necessary, not less. But it also means that the "Life Currently On" might not be a stable baseline anymore. You're designing in real-time disruption. The pattern needs to surface whether you're optimising for adaptability and learning velocity rather than settling into any single future. Product managers especially face this: your skills from five years ago may not protect your role tomorrow. The design practice must include *continuous reskilling and curiosity as a workview*, not just occasional prototyping.

---

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

You're actually running experiments, not just thinking about them. Someone in your team or peer group recently completed a meaningful prototype (took on a project in a new domain, spent time in a different location, tested a different pace). The language people use shifts from "I should" to "I'm testing whether." In meetings, when someone faces a career decision, they naturally ask "What would a prototype look like?" rather than "What should I do?" Workviews and lifeviews are getting revised annually or after significant life events, not left static.

You see reduced burnout in cohorts where this practice is active, and faster recovery when someone does hit a wall. People make lateral moves and role changes that feel *generative* rather than reactive—they've learned something that informs the next step.

**Signs of decay:**

The pattern has become a worksheet exercise divorced from actual experimentation. People describe their "three lives" but never actually prototype any of them. Years pass without anyone updating their workview or lifeview. Practitioners stay in roles long past misalignment, using the language of "gravity problems" to avoid the hard work of testing whether constraints are real. The peer community that once held people accountable to their prototypes dissolves.

You notice people talking about this pattern in the past tense ("I did that design exercise once") rather than present tense. Energy flattens—people stop asking "What am I learning?" and settle into "This is just how it is." New entrants aren't invited into the practice; it becomes a one-time onboarding event rather than a living community discipline.

**When to replant:**

Restart this practice when someone on your team or in your community faces a significant life threshold—a role change, a move, a health shift, the arrival of dependents. These moments of genuine discontinuity make prototyping feel urgent and real rather than theoretical. Similarly, restart it whenever the actual ecosystem changes significantly (economic shift, sector disruption, policy change)—your gravity problems and anchors may have shifted, and your old designs no longer fit.
