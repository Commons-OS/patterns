# GL035 - Trade Secrets

### 1. Overview

A trade secret is a form of intellectual property (IP) that protects confidential information which provides a business with a competitive edge. Unlike patents, trademarks, or copyrights, trade secrets are not registered with any government body. Instead, their legal protection is derived from their inherent secrecy and the active measures taken by a company to safeguard them. The core purpose of a trade secret is to secure exclusive rights to valuable information, such as formulas, practices, processes, designs, instruments, patterns, or compilations of information that are not generally known or reasonably ascertainable by others. The classic example is the formula for Coca-Cola, which has been protected as a trade secret for over a century, far longer than a patent would have allowed.

The primary problem that trade secrets solve in the business context is the protection of valuable, sensitive information that may not be patentable or for which patent protection is not desirable. Patents require public disclosure of the invention, and they have a limited term (typically 20 years). For innovations where the value lies in the long-term confidentiality of the information, or for knowledge that doesn’t meet the strict criteria for patentability, trade secrets offer a vital alternative. They allow businesses to invest in research and development, create unique products and services, and maintain a competitive advantage without being forced to publicize their innovations. The origin of trade secret protection can be traced back to Roman law, but its modern form is rooted in 19th-century English and American common law, developed to prevent employees from disclosing confidential information to competitors.

In the context of commons-aligned value creation, trade secrets present a complex and often contentious issue. On one hand, they represent a form of knowledge enclosure, restricting the free flow of information that is central to the ethos of the commons. This can hinder collaborative innovation and the collective building of knowledge. On the other hand, for commons-oriented enterprises operating within a competitive market, trade secrets can be a pragmatic tool for survival and sustainability. They can protect the enterprise’s unique value proposition, allowing it to generate revenue and continue its mission. The key is to use trade secrets strategically and ethically, in a way that balances the need for protection with a commitment to the commons. This might involve protecting only a small core of information while openly sharing other knowledge, or using the revenue generated from protected information to fund commons-building activities.

### 2. Core Principles

1.  **Confidentiality is Paramount:** The information must not be generally known or readily accessible to the public. The value of a trade secret is directly tied to its secrecy.
2.  **Commercial Value:** The information must have actual or potential economic value from not being generally known. It must provide a competitive advantage.
3.  **Reasonable Efforts to Maintain Secrecy:** The owner must take active and demonstrable steps to protect the information. This can include physical security, digital security, and legal agreements.
4.  **Not a Monopoly Right:** Unlike a patent, a trade secret does not protect against independent discovery or reverse engineering. If someone else develops the same information legally, they are free to use it.
5.  **Perpetual Potential:** A trade secret can last indefinitely, as long as the information remains confidential and continues to have commercial value.
6.  **Ethical Boundaries:** The use of trade secrets should be governed by ethical considerations, especially in commons-aligned enterprises, to avoid creating unnecessary barriers to knowledge sharing and collaboration.

### 3. Key Practices

1.  **Identify and Document Trade Secrets:** Conduct regular audits to identify what information constitutes a trade secret and document it. This includes formulas, processes, customer lists, and business strategies.
2.  **Implement Strong Physical and Digital Security:** Control access to sensitive information through measures like locked cabinets, secure servers, access controls, and encryption.
3.  **Use Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs):** Require employees, contractors, and business partners to sign NDAs before granting them access to trade secrets.
4.  **Employee Training and Exit Interviews:** Educate employees on the importance of confidentiality and conduct exit interviews to remind departing employees of their ongoing obligations.
5.  **Mark Documents as Confidential:** Clearly label documents and files containing trade secrets as "Confidential" or "Proprietary."
6.  **Limit Disclosure:** Share trade secrets only on a "need-to-know" basis, both internally and externally.
7.  **Monitor for Misappropriation:** Actively monitor for any signs of trade secret theft or unauthorized disclosure and be prepared to take legal action if necessary.
8.  **Develop a Response Plan:** Have a plan in place for responding to a suspected or actual trade secret theft, including legal and public relations strategies.

### 4. Implementation

Implementing a trade secret protection program requires a systematic and proactive approach. The first step is to conduct a thorough "IP audit" to identify all the information within the organization that could potentially qualify as a trade secret. This involves a comprehensive review of all departments, from R&D and manufacturing to sales and marketing. Once potential trade secrets are identified, they should be documented and categorized based on their value and sensitivity. This documentation is crucial for any future legal action.

The next step is to implement a multi-layered security program. This includes physical security measures, such as restricting access to certain areas of the facility, and digital security measures, such as firewalls, access controls, and encryption. It is also essential to establish clear policies and procedures for handling confidential information. This includes a "clean desk" policy, rules for using personal devices, and guidelines for sharing information with third parties. A key part of this is the consistent use of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) with anyone who may come into contact with the trade secrets.

Finally, employee education and enforcement are critical. All employees should be trained on the company's trade secret policy and the importance of confidentiality. This training should be ongoing and should be reinforced through regular reminders and updates. When an employee leaves the company, an exit interview should be conducted to remind them of their continuing obligations under their NDA. In the unfortunate event that a trade secret is misappropriated, the company must be prepared to act swiftly and decisively. This may involve sending a cease-and-desist letter, seeking an injunction to prevent further disclosure, and filing a lawsuit for damages. A real-world example is the case of DuPont vs. Kolon Industries, where DuPont was awarded over $900 million in damages for the theft of trade secrets related to its Kevlar body armor.

### 5. 7 Pillars Assessment

| Pillar | Score (1-5) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | 3 | Trade secrets can be used to protect the competitive advantage of a commons-oriented enterprise, enabling it to survive and thrive in a market economy. However, they can also be used to enclose knowledge and hinder collaboration, which is contrary to the purpose of the commons. |
| Governance | 2 | The governance of trade secrets is inherently centralized and opaque, as it relies on secrecy and control. This is in tension with the principles of open and participatory governance that are central to the commons. |
| Culture | 2 | A culture of secrecy can be detrimental to the open and collaborative culture of the commons. It can create an atmosphere of mistrust and can discourage knowledge sharing. |
| Incentives | 4 | Trade secrets can provide a strong incentive for innovation, as they allow a company to capture the economic benefits of its R&D. This can be particularly important for commons-oriented enterprises that need to be financially self-sustaining. |
| Knowledge | 1 | Trade secrets are a form of knowledge enclosure, which is the antithesis of the open knowledge principles of the commons. They restrict the free flow of information and can slow down the pace of innovation. |
| Technology | 3 | Technology can be used to both protect and misappropriate trade secrets. Encryption and access controls can be used to protect them, while hacking and other forms of cybercrime can be used to steal them. |
| Resilience | 4 | By protecting a company's competitive advantage, trade secrets can contribute to its long-term resilience. They can provide a stable source of revenue and can help the company to weather economic downturns. |
| **Overall** | **2.7** | **Trade secrets are a double-edged sword for commons-aligned enterprises. While they can provide a necessary tool for survival in a competitive market, they are in fundamental tension with the core principles of the commons. Their use should be carefully considered and should be balanced with a commitment to open knowledge and collaboration.** |

### 6. When to Use

*   When you have a valuable piece of information that is not patentable.
*   When you want to protect an innovation for a longer period than a patent would allow.
*   When you are in a highly competitive market and need to protect your competitive advantage.
*   When you are a commons-oriented enterprise that needs to generate revenue to be self-sustaining.
*   When you have a "secret sauce" that is central to your brand and value proposition.
*   When the risk of independent discovery or reverse engineering is low.

### 7. Anti-Patterns and Gotchas

*   **Over-reliance on NDAs:** NDAs are important, but they are not a substitute for a comprehensive trade secret protection program.
*   **Failing to take "reasonable measures":** If you don't take active steps to protect your trade secrets, you may lose the ability to enforce your rights in court.
*   **Accidental disclosure:** Be careful not to inadvertently disclose your trade secrets through marketing materials, presentations, or casual conversations.
*   **Employee turnover:** Departing employees are a major source of trade secret theft. Have a robust offboarding process in place.
*   **Ignoring the commons:** For commons-aligned enterprises, using trade secrets in a way that is perceived as greedy or selfish can damage your reputation and undermine your mission.
*   **Thinking you have a trade secret when you don't:** Not all confidential information qualifies as a trade secret. Make sure your information meets the legal criteria.
