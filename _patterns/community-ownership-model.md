### 1. Overview

The Community Ownership Model is a framework for structuring organizations, enterprises, and platforms in a way that vests control and equity in the hands of a defined community rather than concentrating it in the hands of a few founders, executives, or external shareholders. This model represents a fundamental shift from extractive economic paradigms, which prioritize profit maximization for a limited number of stakeholders, towards a more regenerative and distributive approach that aims to build long-term value for all participants. At its core, community ownership is about aligning the governance and financial interests of an entity with the collective well-being of the people it serves and who contribute to its success. This can include users, workers, customers, producers, local residents, or other groups who have a legitimate stake in the organization's activities and impact. By embedding democratic principles and shared equity into the operational DNA of an enterprise, the model seeks to create more resilient, equitable, and sustainable economic systems that are directly accountable to their communities.

The significance of the Community Ownership Model has grown in response to the increasing social and economic inequalities exacerbated by conventional corporate structures and the rise of the digital platform economy. In many sectors, a small number of large corporations have amassed significant market power, leading to the exploitation of labor, the extraction of value from communities, and the erosion of local economies. The platform economy, in particular, has highlighted the tensions between the value created by users and the profits captured by platform owners. Community ownership offers a powerful alternative by providing a legal and operational framework for communities to build and control their own platforms and enterprises, ensuring that the value they create is reinvested locally and distributed more equitably among those who contributed to its generation. This approach not only addresses economic disparities but also fosters a sense of agency, empowerment, and collective efficacy among community members, strengthening social cohesion and democratic participation.

The historical roots of community ownership are deep and varied, drawing inspiration from the cooperative movement of the 19th century, the Civil Rights-era struggles for economic self-determination, and the long tradition of commons-based peer production. The Rochdale Pioneers, who established the first modern cooperative in 1844, laid down a set of principles—including open membership, democratic member control, and member economic participation—that continue to influence community-owned enterprises today. In the United States, the concept gained momentum during the Civil Rights movement with the creation of community land trusts (CLTs) and other collective ownership initiatives designed to empower Black communities and combat systemic discrimination. New Communities, Inc., founded in Georgia in 1969, is widely regarded as the first CLT and served as a model for community-led development. In the digital era, the principles of community ownership have been adapted to the online world through the platform cooperativism movement, which advocates for the creation of cooperatively owned and governed digital platforms as an alternative to the dominant venture capital-funded model.

### 2. Core Principles

1.  **Democratic Member Control:** The principle of democratic member control is the cornerstone of the Community Ownership Model. It ensures that the people who are most affected by an organization's decisions have a meaningful voice in its governance. This is typically achieved through a one-member, one-vote system, regardless of the amount of capital a member has contributed. This democratic structure prevents the concentration of power in the hands of a few and ensures that the organization remains accountable to the broader community it serves. It fosters a culture of participation, transparency, and collective responsibility, where decisions are made in the best interest of the group as a whole.

2.  **Member Economic Participation:** Community ownership models are designed to ensure that the economic benefits generated by the enterprise are distributed fairly among its members. This can take various forms, such as dividends, patronage refunds, or individual equity accounts. By linking economic returns to participation and contribution, rather than just capital investment, the model incentivizes collective success and aligns the financial interests of all stakeholders. This principle directly counters the extractive logic of conventional business models, where the primary goal is to maximize returns for external investors.

3.  **Autonomy and Independence:** Community-owned enterprises are autonomous, self-help organizations controlled by their members. While they may enter into agreements with other organizations or raise capital from external sources, they do so on terms that ensure their continued democratic control and autonomy. This independence is crucial for maintaining the organization's commitment to its mission and its community, protecting it from the pressures of purely profit-driven motives that can arise from external ownership and control.

4.  **Open and Voluntary Membership:** Membership in a community-owned enterprise is typically open to all individuals who can use its services and are willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, without gender, social, racial, political, or religious discrimination. This principle of inclusivity ensures that the organization remains accessible and representative of the community it aims to serve. By welcoming diverse perspectives and experiences, the model strengthens its collective intelligence and its ability to innovate and adapt to changing needs.

5.  **Education, Training, and Information:** Community-owned enterprises have a responsibility to provide education and training for their members, elected representatives, managers, and employees so they can contribute effectively to the development of their organization. They also have a duty to inform the general public about the nature and benefits of community ownership. This commitment to continuous learning and transparency is essential for building the capacity of the community to govern itself effectively and for promoting the broader adoption of the model.

6.  **Cooperation Among Cooperatives:** Community-owned enterprises often work in solidarity with one another, forming local, regional, national, and international networks to strengthen their collective power and impact. By collaborating on joint ventures, sharing best practices, and advocating for supportive policies, they can create a more vibrant and resilient ecosystem for the solidarity economy. This principle of mutual support extends the logic of cooperation beyond the individual enterprise to the broader movement for economic democracy.

7.  **Concern for Community:** While focusing on member needs, community-owned enterprises also work for the sustainable development of their communities through policies approved by their members. This broader concern for the well-being of the community and the environment distinguishes the model from purely self-interested forms of enterprise. It recognizes that the health of the organization is inextricably linked to the health of the community in which it is embedded.

### 3. Key Practices

1.  **Establishing a Clear Legal Structure:** The choice of legal structure is a critical first step in implementing a community ownership model. Common options include cooperative corporations, nonprofit corporations (often used for CLTs), and, more recently, limited cooperative associations (LCAs) and member-managed LLCs. The legal structure should be carefully chosen to align with the organization's mission, governance model, and capital-raising needs, while ensuring that democratic member control is legally protected.

2.  **Developing a Democratic Governance Framework:** A robust governance framework is essential for translating the principle of democratic member control into practice. This includes drafting clear bylaws that define membership rights and responsibilities, establishing a process for electing a board of directors that is accountable to the members, and creating channels for ongoing member participation in decision-making. Many community-owned enterprises also adopt practices like consensus-based decision-making or sociocracy to foster deeper collaboration and inclusivity.

3.  **Designing an Equitable Economic Model:** The economic model should be designed to distribute value fairly among members and to build community wealth over the long term. This involves creating a clear formula for sharing profits or surplus, such as patronage dividends based on usage or equal distributions to all members. For platform cooperatives, this might involve a points system that rewards users for their contributions to the platform, which can then be converted into equity or a share of the revenue.

4.  **Implementing a Community-Centered Capitalization Strategy:** Raising capital is often a major challenge for community-owned enterprises. A community-centered capitalization strategy seeks to raise funds in a way that aligns with the organization's values and maintains its autonomy. This can include member share campaigns, direct public offerings (DPOs), crowdfunding, and partnerships with community development financial institutions (CDFIs) and other values-aligned investors. Some models also use non-extractive financing instruments like revenue-sharing agreements or redeemable preferred shares.

5.  **Fostering a Culture of Participation and Co-creation:** A successful community ownership model depends on the active engagement of its members. This requires a conscious effort to foster a culture of participation, where members feel valued, heard, and empowered to contribute their skills and ideas. This can be achieved through regular communication, participatory design processes, and the creation of opportunities for members to connect with one another and build relationships.

6.  **Building a Supportive Ecosystem:** Community-owned enterprises thrive when they are part of a broader ecosystem of support. This includes partnerships with other cooperatives, mission-aligned nonprofits, local government agencies, and educational institutions. By working together, these organizations can share resources, advocate for supportive policies, and create a more favorable environment for the growth of the solidarity economy.

7.  **Measuring and Reporting on Social and Environmental Impact:** In addition to financial performance, community-owned enterprises should also track and report on their social and environmental impact. This helps to ensure accountability to the community and to demonstrate the value of the model to a wider audience. Impact metrics can include measures of community wealth creation, job quality, carbon footprint reduction, and democratic participation.

### 4. Application Context

**Best Used For:**

*   **Digital Platforms:** Creating cooperatively owned and governed alternatives to extractive platform monopolies in sectors like ride-hailing (The Drivers Cooperative), freelance work (Up & Go), and stock photography (Stocksy United).
*   **Local Economies:** Building community wealth and resilience through locally owned businesses, such as grocery stores (Food co-ops), breweries (Fair State Brewing Cooperative), and renewable energy projects (community solar).
*   **Housing and Real Estate:** Ensuring permanent housing affordability and preventing displacement through community land trusts and limited-equity housing cooperatives.
*   **Data Governance:** Empowering individuals to have greater control over their personal data through the creation of data cooperatives that collectively manage and license data on behalf of their members.

**Not Suitable For:**

*   **Hyper-growth, Exit-Oriented Startups:** The model is fundamentally incompatible with the venture capital model, which prioritizes rapid growth and a quick exit through an acquisition or IPO.
*   **Enterprises Requiring Centralized, Top-Down Control:** The emphasis on democratic governance and member participation makes the model unsuitable for organizations that require a hierarchical command-and-control structure.
*   **Purely Speculative Ventures:** The focus on long-term community value creation is at odds with ventures that are primarily designed for short-term financial speculation.

**Scale:**

The Community Ownership Model is highly scalable and can be applied to enterprises of all sizes, from small, local businesses to large, international platforms. At the local level, the model can be used to create a dense network of community-owned enterprises that form the backbone of a resilient local economy. At the national or international level, platform cooperatives can scale to serve millions of users, demonstrating a viable alternative to the dominant platform monopolies. The scalability of the model is enhanced by the principle of "cooperation among cooperatives," which allows for the creation of federated structures that can achieve economies of scale while maintaining local control and autonomy.

**Domains:**

*   **Technology & Software:** Platform cooperatives, data cooperatives, open-source software projects.
*   **Retail & Consumer Goods:** Food co-ops, community-owned pubs, retail cooperatives.
*   **Energy:** Community solar, wind, and other renewable energy cooperatives.
*   **Housing & Real Estate:** Community land trusts, housing cooperatives, community investment trusts.
*   **Finance:** Credit unions, community development financial institutions (CDFIs), democratic investment funds.
*   **Creative Industries:** Photographer and artist cooperatives, community-owned media outlets.
*   **Care Work:** Childcare and home care worker cooperatives.

### 5. Implementation

Implementing a Community Ownership Model is a complex and multifaceted process that requires careful planning, deep community engagement, and a long-term commitment to the principles of democratic governance and shared equity. The first step is to clearly define the community that the enterprise will serve and to articulate a shared purpose and vision that will guide its development. This foundational work is best done through a participatory process that involves potential members in co-creating the mission and values of the organization. Once a shared vision has been established, the next step is to choose a legal structure that aligns with the organization's goals and provides a solid foundation for democratic member control. This often requires legal expertise to navigate the complexities of cooperative and nonprofit law.

With a legal structure in place, the focus shifts to designing the governance and economic model of the enterprise. This involves drafting bylaws that specify the rights and responsibilities of members, the process for electing a board of directors, and the mechanisms for member participation in decision-making. The economic model must be carefully crafted to ensure that the value generated by the enterprise is distributed fairly and that the organization is financially sustainable. This includes setting membership fees, developing a pricing structure for goods or services, and creating a plan for distributing surplus or profits. Raising capital is often a significant hurdle, and it is important to develop a capitalization strategy that is aligned with the organization's values. This may involve a mix of member equity, community investment, and patient capital from values-aligned funders.

Building a strong and engaged membership is the lifeblood of any community-owned enterprise. This requires a continuous effort to communicate with members, to provide opportunities for them to participate in the life of the organization, and to foster a culture of trust and collaboration. It is also crucial to invest in education and training to build the capacity of members to participate effectively in governance and to understand the financial and operational aspects of the business. Finally, community-owned enterprises should not operate in isolation. They should actively seek to build relationships with other cooperatives and mission-aligned organizations to create a supportive ecosystem that can help them to thrive. This can involve joining cooperative federations, participating in local solidarity economy networks, and advocating for public policies that support the growth of community ownership.

### 6. Evidence & Impact

The Community Ownership Model has a long and proven track record of creating significant economic, social, and environmental benefits. The international cooperative movement, for example, includes over 3 million cooperatives with more than 1.2 billion members worldwide, generating over $2 trillion in annual revenue. These cooperatives provide a wide range of goods and services, from banking and insurance to healthcare and housing, and are a major source of employment in many countries. In the United States, more than 30,000 cooperatives operate in every sector of the economy, and member-owned credit unions have over 100 million members. Research has shown that cooperatives are more resilient than traditional businesses during economic downturns and are more likely to create stable, high-quality jobs.

In the realm of housing, community land trusts have demonstrated their effectiveness in creating and preserving affordable housing in the face of rising real estate prices. There are now over 225 CLTs in the United States, providing affordable homeownership and rental opportunities for thousands of low- and moderate-income families. A study by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy found that CLT homeowners are significantly less likely to be foreclosed on than their counterparts in the conventional market. In the digital economy, a growing number of platform cooperatives are challenging the extractive practices of the dominant platform monopolies. While still a nascent movement, platform co-ops like Stocksy United, a photographer-owned stock photo agency, have shown that it is possible to build successful, multi-million dollar businesses that are democratically governed and that distribute profits fairly among their members.

### 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

The rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning presents both significant opportunities and profound challenges for the Community Ownership Model. On the one hand, AI can be a powerful tool for enhancing the efficiency, effectiveness, and democratic potential of community-owned enterprises. For example, AI-powered platforms could be used to facilitate more inclusive and deliberative decision-making processes at scale, to optimize the management of shared resources in a community-owned microgrid, or to create personalized learning pathways that build the capacity of members to participate in governance. Data cooperatives could leverage AI to generate valuable insights from their members' data while protecting their privacy and ensuring that the value of those insights is shared collectively.

On the other hand, the increasing use of AI also raises critical questions about power, control, and accountability. If not designed and governed with intention, AI systems can perpetuate and even amplify existing biases and inequalities. The concentration of AI expertise and infrastructure in the hands of a few large tech companies poses a significant threat to the autonomy and independence of community-owned enterprises. To harness the potential of AI for the common good, the community ownership movement must actively engage in the development of "cooperative AI," which seeks to build AI systems that are aligned with cooperative principles and that are democratically controlled by the communities they serve. This will require a concerted effort to build AI literacy within the movement, to advocate for public investment in open and democratic AI infrastructure, and to develop new governance frameworks for the age of intelligent machines.

### 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

- **Shared Resource Potential:** High - The Community Ownership Model is inherently designed to create and manage shared resources, whether they be physical assets like land and buildings, or digital assets like data and software. By taking these resources out of the speculative market and placing them under community stewardship, the model ensures that they are managed for the long-term benefit of all.

- **Democratic Governance:** High - Democratic governance is a defining feature of the Community Ownership Model. The principle of one-member, one-vote ensures that decision-making power is distributed equitably among all members, preventing the concentration of control in the hands of a few. This commitment to democratic process is a fundamental alignment with commons principles.

- **Equitable Access:** High - The principle of open and voluntary membership ensures that community-owned enterprises are accessible to all who can use their services, without discrimination. The model is designed to promote equitable access to essential goods and services, such as affordable housing, healthy food, and fair financial services.

- **Sustainability:** High - Community-owned enterprises are more likely to adopt sustainable practices because they are not driven by the short-term profit motives of external investors. Their concern for the long-term well-being of the community and the environment leads them to take a more holistic and regenerative approach to their operations.

- **Community Benefit:** High - The primary purpose of a community-owned enterprise is to provide a benefit to its members and the broader community, rather than to generate a profit for external shareholders. The model is designed to build community wealth, create local jobs, and strengthen the social fabric of the community. This focus on community benefit is the ultimate expression of its alignment with commons principles.
