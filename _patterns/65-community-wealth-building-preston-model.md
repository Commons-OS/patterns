### 1. Overview

Community Wealth Building (CWB) is a systems-based approach to local economic development focused on creating an inclusive, resilient, and equitable economy by reorganizing and controlling local assets. The Preston Model is a pioneering UK implementation of CWB from Preston, Lancashire, challenging conventional top-down economic strategies that often lead to wealth extraction. It addresses the cyclical disinvestment faced by post-industrial cities by redirecting existing community wealth to build a stronger, self-reliant local economy for all residents.

The Preston Model emerged in 2011 after the collapse of a £700 million city center redevelopment project. This failure prompted Preston City Council, led by Councillor Matthew Brown, to partner with the Centre for Local Economic Strategies (CLES). Inspired by the "Cleveland Model" and the Mondragon Corporation, they adapted CWB principles to Preston's context. The model leverages "anchor institutions"—large, local public sector organizations—to use their procurement, employment, and assets to foster a democratic, locally-rooted economy.

### 2. Core Principles

The Preston Model's interconnected principles, adapted from the broader CWB movement, guide anchor institutions and local stakeholders in building a democratic and resilient local economy.

1.  **Plural and Democratic Ownership:** This principle fosters a diverse business ecosystem beyond large private corporations by encouraging cooperatives, employee-owned businesses, and social enterprises. The goal is to broaden capital ownership, retain profits locally, and increase business accountability to the community.

2.  **Local Financial Power:** This principle harnesses local financial resources by encouraging the use of local banks and credit unions, exploring a regional community bank, and leveraging public pension funds for local projects with social and financial returns.

3.  **Fair Employment:** The model promotes high-quality, stable employment with fair wages and conditions, pushing for a "Real Living Wage" city. It also emphasizes skills development and employment pathways for marginalized residents to ensure shared economic benefits.

4.  **Progressive Procurement:** This well-known principle involves shifting anchor institution procurement to prioritize local suppliers. By redirecting their purchasing power, the model creates stable demand, helping local firms grow and create jobs, recognizing procurement's power in shaping the local economy.

5.  **Socially Productive Asset Use:** This principle advocates for the strategic use of public land and property for community benefit, such as affordable housing, community enterprises, or renewable energy. The aim is to generate long-term social, economic, and environmental value rather than short-term financial gain.

### 3. Key Practices

The Preston Model's core principles are translated into practical actions that form the operational heart of the model, demonstrating how anchor institutions and partners can reshape the local economy.

1.  **Anchor Institution Spend Analysis:** This foundational practice involves a detailed annual analysis of each anchor institution's procurement spend to identify opportunities for local sourcing. The initial analysis in Preston, for example, showed that only 5% of the anchors' £750m spend was local, creating the impetus for change.

2.  **Progressive Procurement Policies:** Anchor institutions adopt progressive procurement policies, including breaking down large contracts, prioritizing social value in tender evaluations, and engaging with local suppliers to help them navigate the process.

3.  **Cooperative and Social Enterprise Development:** The model supports the growth of businesses with democratic ownership structures by providing business support, identifying market gaps, and creating a supportive network for social enterprises and cooperatives.

4.  **Local Financial Ecosystem:** The model promotes local financial institutions, including a campaign for a regional community bank, to provide affordable finance and ensure financial decisions serve the local community.

5.  **Anchor Mission Commitments:** Anchor institutions formally adopt a "community wealth building mission," embedding CWB principles into their core strategies to ensure it is a central part of their identity and purpose.

6.  **Fair Employment Charter:** The model champions a Fair Employment Charter, encouraging employers to commit to standards like the Real Living Wage, secure employment, and skills development.

7.  **Community Land Trusts and Asset Transfer:** The model supports Community Land Trusts (CLTs) and the strategic transfer of public assets to community ownership to ensure the socially productive use of land and property.

### 4. Application Context

The Preston Model's effectiveness depends on context and scale; understanding its ideal application is key to successful replication.

-   **Best Used For:** Post-industrial cities seeking economic renewal, areas with strong anchor institutions, tackling persistent inequality, and building local economic resilience.

-   **Not Suitable For:** Areas lacking political will or anchor institution buy-in, contexts requiring rapid, large-scale job creation, and economies dominated by a single, mobile industry.

-   **Scale:** The model's primary focus is the **Multi-Organizational/Ecosystem** level, creating a collaborative ecosystem. Its principles also apply at the **Organization**, **Department**, and **Team/Individual** scales.

-   **Domains:** The model impacts a wide range of domains, including Public Administration, Healthcare, Education, Housing, Construction, Food and Catering, Professional Services, and Social Care.

### 5. Implementation

Implementing the Preston Model is a strategic, long-term process of institutional and cultural change, not a simple checklist.

- **Prerequisites:** Political leadership, a coalition of willing anchor institutions, baseline data and analytical capacity, and a dedicated coordinating body.

- **Getting Started:** Form an anchor network, conduct a baseline spend analysis, identify quick wins, develop a shared action plan, and communicate the vision.

- **Common Challenges:** Overcoming institutional inertia, navigating procurement law, lack of local supply chain capacity, and measuring and demonstrating impact.

- **Success Factors:** Sustained, collaborative leadership; a long-term, patient approach; data-driven decision making; and community engagement and empowerment.

### 6. Evidence & Impact

The Preston Model has gained significant attention for its innovative approach and tangible results, with evidence of its impact in economic data, social outcomes, and its adoption by other localities.

- **Notable Adopters:** The Preston Model has inspired other UK localities like Birmingham and Manchester to implement CWB strategies, and is being studied and adapted internationally.

- **Documented Outcomes:** The most cited impact is the shift in local procurement. Between 2013 and 2017, anchor institution spending in Preston increased from 5% to 18.2% (£74 million boost), and in Lancashire from 39% to 79.2% (over £200 million increase). Preston also became the first accredited Living Wage City in the north of England.

- **Research Support:** The model's impact is documented in reports by CLES and Preston City Council, The Democracy Collaborative, and academic studies from institutions like the University of Central Lancashire and the British Medical Journal.

### 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

The Preston Model's principles are well-suited for the Cognitive Era. AI, data analytics, and automation can enhance CWB's effectiveness and scalability, while highlighting the importance of human judgment.

- **Cognitive Augmentation Potential:** AI can enhance spend analysis, map and develop the local supply chain, and create intelligent tendering platforms to simplify procurement for small businesses.

- **Human-Machine Balance:** The core of the model remains human-centric, focusing on relationship building, ethical judgments in procurement, and nurturing democratic ownership.

- **Evolution Outlook:** The model will likely evolve into an AI-optimized system, with digital twins for policy simulation and predictive capabilities for economic needs. The challenge is to ensure this evolution serves the goal of a democratic, equitable, and human-centered economy.

### 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

The Preston Model represents a significant shift away from extractive, conventional economic development towards a more commons-oriented approach. Its alignment with the principles of a commons is strong, though with opportunities for further development. This assessment evaluates the model against the seven dimensions of commons alignment.

1.  **Stakeholder Mapping**: The model is built on a foundation of comprehensive stakeholder mapping, centered on the concept of "anchor institutions." This explicitly identifies key public and non-profit organizations as central actors with a stake in the local economy. The model also implicitly includes local businesses, employees, and residents as key stakeholders who benefit from its interventions. The mapping is comprehensive in its identification of institutional actors, but could be strengthened by more formalized mechanisms for engaging residents and smaller community groups in the governance of the anchor network itself.

2.  **Value Creation**: The Preston Model excels at creating and retaining multiple forms of value. It shifts the focus from the singular pursuit of financial profit to a more holistic view of value that includes:
    *   **Economic Value:** Increased local economic activity, job creation, and business growth.
    *   **Social Value:** Improved wages, better working conditions, and increased community cohesion.
    *   **Institutional Value:** Stronger, more collaborative relationships between anchor institutions.
    The primary beneficiaries are local businesses, their employees, and the wider community that benefits from a more resilient and inclusive economy. The value is captured locally, directly countering the extractive tendencies of conventional models.

3.  **Value Preservation**: The model is designed for long-term value preservation. By building local institutions (cooperatives, a potential community bank) and embedding CWB principles into the core mission of anchor institutions, it seeks to create a self-sustaining system that is not dependent on short-term political cycles or external funding. The focus on building local supply chains and skills also enhances the long-term productive capacity of the local economy, preserving its ability to create value over time.

4.  **Shared Rights & Responsibilities**: The model promotes a distribution of rights and responsibilities. Anchor institutions take on the responsibility of being civic actors, using their economic power for the collective good. The promotion of cooperatives and employee ownership directly distributes economic rights (ownership and control) to workers. However, the rights of residents to directly participate in the governance of the overall strategy could be more formally defined. While the model is implemented by a democratically elected council, more direct forms of participatory governance could enhance this dimension.

5.  **Systematic Design**: The Preston Model is a highly systematic design for local economic development. It is not a collection of ad-hoc projects, but an integrated system where each component reinforces the others. The spend analysis informs the procurement strategy, which in turn creates opportunities for cooperative development, which is then supported by the drive for local financial institutions. This systematic approach is one of its key strengths.

6.  **Systems of Systems**: The model demonstrates a strong understanding of the economy as a system of systems. It recognizes that the local economy is interconnected with regional, national, and global systems, and seeks to reshape the local system to be more resilient and less dependent on the whims of global capital. It also composes well with other patterns, such as the promotion of the Real Living Wage and the development of a circular economy.

7.  **Fractal Properties**: The core principles of the Preston Model exhibit fractal properties, applying at multiple scales. The idea of using existing resources for local benefit can be applied at the level of an individual household, a neighborhood, a city, or a region. The principles of democratic ownership and fair employment are scalable from a small cooperative to a large anchor institution.

**Overall Score: 3 - Transitional**

The Preston Model is a leading example of a transitional economic model. It represents a significant and successful move away from the extractive logic of neoliberalism towards a more commons-aligned approach. It has demonstrably shifted economic outcomes and has created a powerful new narrative about what is possible in local economic development.

**Rationale**: The score of 3 reflects the fact that while the model is highly aligned in its principles and practices, it is still operating within a broader, dominant economic system that is not aligned with the commons. The model is a powerful intervention to counter this system at the local level, but it is not (and does not claim to be) a fully-realized commons in itself. It is a transitional strategy, building the institutions and culture that could lead to a more fully-fledged commons economy over time.

**Opportunities for Improvement**: To move towards a higher level of commons alignment, the model could focus on:
*   **Deepening Democratic Participation:** Creating more formal mechanisms for residents and community groups to participate in the governance of the anchor network.
*   **Expanding Community Ownership:** Moving beyond a focus on anchor institutions to more actively support community ownership of land, energy, and other key assets.
*   **Developing Alternative Financial Systems:** Accelerating the development of a regional community bank and other forms of non-extractive finance.
