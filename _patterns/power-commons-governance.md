# Power in Commons Governance

Understand power dynamics in commons governance systems so you can build commons that share power widely while maintaining decision-making capacity.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Commons Theory.

---

### Section 1: Context

Commons-based systems are alive and vulnerable to the same power consolidation forces that corrupt hierarchies. Whether you're stewarding a digital platform, managing shared land, coordinating a social movement, or building organizational culture, the question emerges early: Who decides what? The system starts with good intentions—distributed, inclusive, transparent. But within months or years, informal authority crystallizes into de facto rule by a few. In corporate settings, founding teams hoard budget control. In public service commons, technical experts become gatekeepers. In activist networks, those with time and access dominate strategy. In open-source products, maintainer burnout breeds either autocracy or paralysis.

The living ecosystem of commons governance is always in motion. It grows when power flows widely and decisions stay rooted in the collective's real work. It fragments when some members feel unheard while others exhaust themselves deciding everything. It stagnates when formal procedures exist but real power sits elsewhere—an invisible second government that makes the first one theater. The pattern emerges from the tension between the need for shared power (which builds legitimacy, resilience, and participation) and the need for governance to actually work (which requires clarity, speed, and accountability). Without understanding this tension, commons wither into either tyranny-by-consensus or chaos-by-paralysis.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Power vs. Governance.**

In commons governance, power and governance want opposite things. Power wants to stay distributed and fluid—no concentration, no hierarchy, everyone's voice counts equally. But governance wants to crystallize that power into reliable structures so decisions actually happen and can be reviewed.

When power and governance are unexamined, one usually wins by default. Power advocates build consensus processes that slow decisions to a crawl and exhaust the most engaged members (who end up deciding anyway). Governance advocates create formal rules that seem neutral but quietly concentrate authority in whoever interprets them—the lawyer, the expert, the oldest member, the one with institutional memory.

The real cost is vitality. When power gets hoarded, excluded members stop participating. When governance breaks down, the commons can't respond to real problems. Land commons collapse under unmanaged grazing. Organizational culture decays into politicking and burnout. Open-source projects fork when maintainers become bottlenecks. Social movements fragment when decisions feel predetermined by hidden elites.

The unresolved tension appears as symptoms: decisions that satisfy no one, meetings where some voices fill 80% of air time while others stay silent, new members who never find their place, founding members who burn out from unspoken responsibility, formal rules that nobody follows because real power lives elsewhere. The commons keeps functioning on surface but atrophies underneath—vitality leaks away even as the structure remains intact.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, make power flows visible and name who decides what kind of decision, embedding that clarity into living practice rather than static policy.**

This pattern works by treating power like nutrients in soil—it needs to circulate, be replenished, and reach all parts of the system. Instead of trying to distribute power equally (impossible and often paralyzing), you map where power actually lives and create feedback loops that keep it from pooling.

The mechanism has three moving parts, rooted in commons theory:

First, **distinguish kinds of decisions**. Not all decisions deserve equal voice. Operational choices (who facilitates this week's meeting) need speed; strategic choices (what problems we solve) need breadth; boundary choices (who gets to join) need legitimacy. Different decision kinds distribute power differently without pretending equality. This mirrors how healthy ecosystems have specialized roles—not all organisms make food the same way.

Second, **make the actual power structure visible**. Name who has veto power, who has voice, who has a vote, who gets consulted. This sounds simple but almost no commons do it clearly. The moment you write down "the finance circle decides budget within the assembly's values," three things happen: people know where they stand, conflicts become debates about the right decision-kind (not about hidden power), and you can evolve the structure as conditions change.

Third, **rotate and refresh power-holding roles**. Power consolidates through habit and fatigue. The person who knows the system becomes the person who controls it. Build term limits, mentor successors, deliberately move people between roles, and create paths for dormant members to step into authority. This is active cultivation—without it, power calcifies.

The result is commons that stay vital because power moves enough to stay distributed, yet structured enough to actually decide and act.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**In corporate settings**, start by auditing where decisions actually live. Create a decision register: list every recurring choice your team faces (hiring, project scope, resource allocation, culture norms). For each, write down the current decision-maker and the current voice structure. Share this openly with your team. You'll likely find that "we decide together" masks reality where the CEO or lead engineer decides everything except scheduling. Rebuild trust by naming this and choosing which decisions genuinely need collective intelligence. For hiring, maybe 3–5 people have veto power; for daily standups, anyone can suggest changes. Rotate the facilitator and keeper roles quarterly. Establish a term limit (say, 18 months) for anyone in a power-holding role.

**In government and public service**, apply this to the feedback-learning domain where it lives: who shapes which policies, who learns from implementation, who adjusts course? Create explicit "co-governance councils" for service areas that directly name stakeholder roles: service staff get decision power on operations, affected residents get decision power on values and goals, technical experts advise on feasibility. Hold quarterly power audits: ask staff, residents, and officials where decisions actually happened and whether it matched the formal structure. Document gaps. In a public health commons, for instance, frontline workers decide triage protocols; residents affected by side effects decide safety thresholds; epidemiologists advise on evidence. Make those roles formal and visible, not hidden assumptions.

**In activist and movement contexts**, implement "mandate rotation" and "power apprenticeship." At the start of each campaign season, explicitly redistribute coordination roles. If the same three people ran logistics last time, recruit and train new logistics leads. Create shadowing relationships: every person with formal power mentors someone for succession. Document decisions in real time—not just outcomes, but how the decision was made, who was consulted, and why. This becomes the commons' memory and teaches new members how power actually works. Build in "power pauses": quarterly conversations where the group asks, "Is this how we wanted decisions to happen? Who's exhausted? Who hasn't been heard?" For movements working across organizations, create federated decision-making: each org holds power on its own work, but decisions affecting all get made in a deliberate cross-org space with clear delegates.

**In technology and product commons**, embed power transparency into your governance code itself. Open-source projects should publish a GOVERNANCE.md file that explicitly states: who can merge code (and under what criteria), who can set direction, how new maintainers are selected, how conflicts are resolved. For decentralized products, use role-based access controls that are auditable and reviewable. Run quarterly "power health checks": analyze who opened issues, who reviewed code, who pushed merges—are the patterns matching your stated values? If three people do 70% of merges, that's data. Create onboarding paths that move contributors from observer → reviewer → maintainer, with explicit skill-building. Use delegation tokens or voting systems that prevent power concentration: no single person controls the merge button indefinitely.

---

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:** When power flows are visible and intentionally managed, the commons develops adaptive capacity. New members find entry points because roles are named, not mystical. Decision-making speeds up because people know where their voice counts most. Conflict becomes resolvable because disagreement can be about the decision itself, not about who secretly holds authority. Burnout decreases because responsibility distributes more evenly and people don't exhaust themselves guessing the real power structure. Trust builds because alignment between stated and actual governance rebuilds legitimacy. Over time, a commons practicing this pattern develops what commons theory calls "redundancy of function"—multiple people can facilitate, steward, decide—so the system doesn't fragment when one person leaves.

**What risks emerge:** The pattern's vitality score (3.7) reflects a critical vulnerability: it maintains existing health but doesn't reliably generate new adaptive capacity. Watch for **ossification**: if you formalize power structures too early, they harden into new hierarchies that are harder to change because they're now "official." The solution is to keep revisiting and revising the structure. A second risk is **rotational burnout**: moving people too quickly through roles before they develop competence breeds resentment and incompetence. Build skill-development into rotation, not just turnover. Third, **low resilience (3.0)** means this pattern alone doesn't build redundancy—it only prevents hidden power concentration. Pair it with deep apprenticeship and cross-training to truly build resilience. Finally, **low autonomy and composability (both 3.0)** suggest the pattern can feel prescriptive and brittle across different commons contexts. Adapt it to your ecology; don't apply it mechanically.

### Section 6: Known Uses

The **Mondragon Corporation** in Spain has stewarded power distribution across 80+ worker cooperatives for 70 years through a pattern that maps directly here. Every cooperative explicitly states: workers elect representatives quarterly, representatives serve on governance boards with term limits, major strategic decisions require super-majority votes in general assembly, technical decisions stay with operational teams. No single person can hold executive power indefinitely. The result is a network that survives leadership transitions and maintains worker legitimacy across generations. The system isn't perfect—some coops are more democratic than others—but the visible power structure and enforced rotation prevent calcification.

The **Linux Foundation's governance model** for major open-source projects (including Kubernetes) uses explicit decision-kind mapping: maintainers decide code merges and technical direction within an explicit mandate; a steering committee decides long-term strategy and resolves disputes; working groups decide operational details. New maintainers are selected through nomination and community consensus, with explicit attention to diversity and geographic distribution. This prevents the single-founder autocracy that killed many earlier open-source projects. Power rotates through quarterly reports and documented decision-making, making the actual structure visible to contributors. The pattern directly addresses tech contexts where invisible authority can crystallize around whoever understands the codebase best.

In **urban commons governance**, the **Huerta Digitala platform in Barcelona** explicitly models power for shared urban gardens. Each garden elects a stewardship team annually; the team manages plots and maintenance but must publish monthly decisions (who got plots, why, conflicts resolved) to the neighborhood commons. Residents not on the team can propose new initiatives through a formal input process. The city provides resources but explicitly does not decide garden operations. This visible power distribution prevents gardens from becoming fiefdoms of longtime members while keeping daily decisions fast. When new gardeners join, they can see exactly how decisions get made and how they can build toward leadership.

---

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age of algorithmic decision-making and distributed intelligence systems, power in commons governance shifts in ways the pattern must address. AI systems can help make power flows *more* visible through data: which voices get heard, whose proposals get implemented, who holds effective veto power revealed through pattern analysis. But AI also creates new opacity—decisions mediated through models feel neutral when they're actually encoding embedded power relationships. A commons using AI to analyze meeting transcripts might discover that women's ideas get acknowledged but men's get acted on; that's powerful accountability. But if you let an algorithm "optimize" decision-making, you're outsourcing power to whoever trained the model.

The tech context translation demands that commons explicitly govern their governing tools. If you use voting apps, who designed the voting interface? If you use chatbots to manage membership, what biases did they inherit? If you use recommendation systems to surface good ideas, whose good ideas get highlighted? These are power questions. Modern commons need to add a layer: **tool governance**. Name who selects which decision-support technology, audit it for bias, make that selection visible and revisable.

The pattern also benefits from new leverage: distributed ledger systems (blockchain, not the hype version) can create immutable, auditable records of decisions that prevent later rewriting of history. Federated identity systems can separate participation rights from membership, allowing people to hold power in multiple commons without concentration. Asynchronous decision-making tools let commons operate across time zones without privileging whoever can attend meetings. But all these tools require the same foundational work: visible power mapping and intentional rotation. You can't delegate that to technology.

---

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:** The commons shows vitality when power actually rotates—you see different people in facilitation, decision-making, and stewardship roles across seasons. When conflicts happen (they should), people disagree about the decision itself, not about hidden authority. When new members join, they can name within a month how decisions actually get made and where they could step into influence. When long-term members leave, the commons doesn't collapse because responsibility isn't concentrated in individuals. Decision cycle times are predictable and documented—people know when they'll hear back, who decides, and why. In meetings and forums, air time roughly correlates with whoever has relevant expertise or stake, not with tenure or personality dominance.

**Signs of decay:** The commons is losing vitality when the "real" power structure diverges from the official one and everyone knows it but doesn't say it. When new members never move into roles of influence despite formally being equal. When the same 2–3 people are exhausted because they're making all decisions while official decision-makers are decorative. When conflicts become personal grievances instead of structural questions—"they're power-hungry" instead of "the decision-making process concentrates power here." When proposals from some people get heard as brilliant and from others get tabled for more discussion. When people check out of meetings because their voice doesn't matter. When institutional memory sits entirely in one person's head. When term limits exist on paper but are waived in practice because "they're the only ones who understand it."

**When to replant:** Replant this pattern when you notice power hardening around individuals or when a turnover event forces confrontation with hidden authority structures (a key person leaves, external pressure forces transparency, a conflict explodes). The right moment is when the commons feels the strain but still has energy to reimagine governance—not so early it feels forced, not so late it's reactive to crisis. Start by auditing: actually ask people where decisions live. Document it. Then design new structures together. This pattern works best as continuous practice, not one-time fix. Revisit it quarterly.
