_# Pattern: Vulnerability Management

## 1. Pattern Name and Number

**S042: Vulnerability Management**

## 2. Problem

All software has bugs, and some of those bugs are security vulnerabilities. New vulnerabilities are discovered every day in both open-source libraries and commercial software. If these vulnerabilities are not proactively identified and remediated, they create an open door for attackers to compromise systems. Simply waiting for an attacker to exploit a vulnerability is a recipe for disaster.

## 3. Context

You are operating any software-based system. You must assume that the components of your system (your own code, third-party libraries, the operating system, etc.) contain vulnerabilities. You need a systematic process to find, assess, and fix these vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

## 4. Solution

**Implement a continuous and proactive vulnerability management program to identify, classify, remediate, and mitigate vulnerabilities across your entire technology stack.**

The vulnerability management lifecycle includes:
1.  **Discover**: Maintain a comprehensive inventory of all assets (servers, applications, libraries) in your environment.
2.  **Scan**: Regularly scan all assets for known vulnerabilities. This includes using Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to find vulnerabilities in third-party libraries, and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) or Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools to find vulnerabilities in your own code.
3.  **Assess and Prioritize**: Not all vulnerabilities are created equal. Assess the severity of each vulnerability based on factors like the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score, whether an exploit is publicly available, and the criticality of the affected asset. Prioritize the most critical vulnerabilities for immediate remediation.
4.  **Remediate**: Fix the vulnerability, typically by applying a patch from the vendor or by fixing the bug in your own code.
5.  **Verify**: Scan the asset again to verify that the vulnerability has been successfully remediated.

## 5. Rationale

A vulnerability management program is a fundamental practice of good security hygiene. It:
- **Reduces the Attack Surface**: Proactively closes the security holes that attackers would otherwise exploit.
- **Provides a Systematic Approach**: Replaces a reactive, chaotic "patch when breached" approach with a proactive and risk-based process.
- **Improves Security Posture**: Provides a measurable way to track and improve the overall security of your systems over time.
- **Ensures Compliance**: It is a core requirement of most cybersecurity regulations and compliance frameworks.

## 6. Consequences

- **Positive**:
    - A significant reduction in the risk of being compromised by known vulnerabilities.
    - A more proactive and less reactive security posture.
    - Clear metrics to measure and report on the health of the security program.
- **Negative**:
    - Can be a resource-intensive process, requiring dedicated tools and personnel.
    - Patching can sometimes cause operational issues or break existing functionality, requiring careful testing.
    - The sheer volume of vulnerabilities can be overwhelming, making prioritization absolutely critical.

## 7. Known Uses

- **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**: Tools like Snyk, Dependabot (GitHub), and Black Duck scan your code's dependencies to find known vulnerabilities in open-source libraries.
- **Vulnerability Scanners**: Tools like Nessus, Qualys, and OpenVAS scan networks and servers for known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
- **Patch Tuesday**: Microsoft's monthly release of security patches is a well-known part of the vulnerability management lifecycle for Windows systems.
