Good documentation of knowledge—methods, decisions, rationales—makes knowledge accessible and remixable.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Knowledge Management.

---

### Section 1: Context

Knowledge fragmenting across silos is the condition most commons face. In organizations, tacit expertise lives in individual heads—when people leave, capability drains. In activist movements, hard-won tactical learning evaporates between campaigns. In government, institutional memory disappears with electoral cycles. In tech products, architectural rationales vanish, forcing future developers to reverse-engineer decisions. The system is neither growing nor stagnating; it's *leaking*. 

Value is created but not retained. Trust compounds where knowledge remains transparent—stakeholders can see *why* decisions were made, not just *what* was decided. Without this visibility, each new person rebuilds from scratch. The commons requires that knowledge become *remixable*: available for others to adapt, build upon, and evolve. Documentation is the root system that makes this possible. Without it, the organization functions but doesn't learn; the movement gains ground but loses wisdom; the product works but resists change.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Documenting vs. Access.**

Practitioners face a genuine bind. Documenting takes time—writing rationales, capturing process, making knowledge legible for strangers. It slows immediate work. Teams under deadline pressure ask: "Who will read this? Can't we just move?" Meanwhile, the hunger for access is real and growing. New members arrive needing to understand context without pestering busy veterans. Decisions get remade because nobody knows the previous attempt failed. Effort compounds because learning isn't shared.

The tension sharpens in these forms:

**Documenting demands care.** Good documentation isn't auto-generated transcripts. It requires someone to slow down, extract meaning, translate tacit knowledge into explicit form. It's labor. **Access demands openness.** But opening knowledge also exposes half-finished thinking, provisional decisions, messy debate—which carries reputational risk.

**Time vs. permanence.** Work moves fast; documentation lingers. What was true yesterday becomes outdated tomorrow. Maintaining docs becomes another burden. **Audience friction.** Who documents for whom? A technical architecture doc written for engineers alienates movement members; a process guide written for newcomers bores veterans.

When unresolved, the system suffers knowledge decay. Institutional learning plateaus. Each crisis feels new because nobody can reference the last one. Trust erodes because decisions seem arbitrary. The commons becomes fragile because it cannot scale beyond the people who hold the knowledge.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, embed documentation as a living practice within the work itself—not a separate task—where every decision, method, and rationale is captured at the moment of creation, then continuously tended like a root system that feeds the whole commons.**

Documentation-as-practice reverses the timing problem. Instead of documenting *after* work is done, you document *during* creation. When a decision is made in real time, the reasoning is fresh. Capture it then. When a method works, the person who wielded it can articulate it immediately. This shifts documentation from overhead to integral practice—part of how work gets done, not a debt owed later.

This pattern also reframes access as a design problem, not a permission problem. Instead of asking "who can see this?", ask "what form does this knowledge need to take for different people to use it?" A decision captured as raw meeting notes serves historians and auditors. The same decision extracted as a principle and templated serves future practitioners. Composable documentation—breakable into pieces, remixable for different contexts—serves more people simultaneously.

Living systems language: Documentation is the nutrient cycling of the commons. Without it, nitrogen accumulates in one place (expertise concentrates in individuals) while other parts starve. Good documentation moves nutrients around, making knowledge available where growth is needed. But like all cycling, it requires tending. Dead documentation becomes toxic—outdated guidance that misleads. The pattern works when documentation is treated as living material: written with assumption of change, reviewed for decay, intentionally pruned.

The knowledge traditions that support this (particularly Knowledge Management as discipline) teach that the *form* of documentation shapes what can be known and used. A decision stored only in someone's memory is captured by that person's cognitive limits. The same decision stored in multiple forms—principle card, decision log, template, story—becomes accessible to different minds, different roles, different future moments.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**In corporate contexts:** Establish a *Decision Ledger* at the start of each project—a shared document or version-controlled file where every significant choice is logged with three fields: *What was decided*, *Why (the rationale and trade-offs)*, *Who dissented*. Assign one rotating role per sprint to "document keeper"—someone who reads decisions back to the team daily to catch gaps. Make the ledger a required read for anyone joining mid-project. Link architectural decisions to design documents; link process changes to team playbooks. Create a 6-month review cycle where outdated entries are explicitly marked "superseded" rather than deleted, creating a legible change history.

**In activist movements:** Build a *Campaign Memory Kit*—a standardized folder structure that every campaign creates before launch: *Decisions Made* (why this approach, what was rejected), *Tactics Used* (what worked, what flopped, exact conditions), *Relationships Tended* (who we partnered with, what they needed, what we learned), *Resources Built* (templates, scripts, training materials). Assign the kit's upkeep to someone in early phases when the path is clearest. Before campaign wind-down, run a half-day *Wisdom Harvest*—bring core people together to extract lessons while memory is hot. Publish it (anonymize sensitive details) so adjacent movements can build on your learning, not repeat your mistakes.

**In government:** Establish a *Policy Archaeology Layer*—a structured archive within your system that captures not just final policy but its genealogy: *What problem prompted this policy*, *What options were considered*, *Why alternatives were rejected*, *What assumptions held at the time*. Build this into the policy-drafting template itself; make evidence collection part of the standard process, not an afterthought. When policies change, new drafters should inherit the old reasoning—not start blind. Create a quarterly *Institutional Learning Forum* where different departments surface recurring problems and check whether others have already solved them. This prevents siloed solutions and compounds institutional adaptive capacity.

**In tech products:** Document not just *what* the code does but *why it was designed that way*—store this as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in the repo itself, versioned alongside the code. Link each ADR to its decision context, trade-offs, and alternatives rejected. Create a *Release Notes Pattern*: every release includes not just feature changes but *reasoning changes*—if the way people should use the product evolved, say why. Build a *Rationale Index* that lets developers search for past decisions by problem type ("We solved pagination like this before—here's why we chose that approach"). Onboard new team members by having them submit a "Rationale Challenge"—they pick a piece of code or design, hunt down its original decision record, then write a brief reflection. This makes documentation a generative learning experience, not a compliance chore.

**Cross-context action:** Institute a *Documentation Rotation*—every quarter, someone shifts into a "knowledge translation" role for 2–4 weeks. Their job: read recent decisions/work, extract the implicit, make it legible. This breaks the bottleneck of "the person who did it" being the only person who can explain it. Pay or credit this work fairly; it's skilled labor. Create a *decay detection ritual*—monthly, scan documentation for signs of rot: outdated links, contradictions with current practice, guidance that no longer fits. Mark what's stale. This is lighter than full maintenance but prevents zombie knowledge.

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

New members onboard faster because institutional knowledge isn't locked in conversation. Decisions compound: when you can see why something was tried before, you don't remake the same mistake. Distributed decision-making becomes possible—people can make locally-good choices because they understand the frame. Trust deepens because people can see the reasoning, not just the outcome. In activist contexts, learning scales across campaigns; in tech, architectural wisdom accumulates; in government, policy gets smarter over time. The commons develops *memory*, which is the foundation of adaptive capacity.

**What risks emerge:**

Documentation can ossify into dogma if not explicitly marked as provisional. People treat old decisions as laws rather than data points, blocking necessary evolution. The pattern risks creating *documentation debt*—what gets written becomes a liability if nobody maintains it; outdated docs mislead more than no docs at all. 

Resilience scores (3.0) flag this: documentation alone doesn't generate adaptive capacity; it only preserves it. A highly-documented system can still be brittle if documentation calcifies practice. Watch for teams that spend more energy *keeping records consistent* than *learning from records*. 

Access disparities can widen if documentation defaults to insider language—technical jargon, institutional acronyms. The documented knowledge becomes legible to some, alien to others, deepening rather than bridging silos. In corporate contexts, archived decisions can become ammunition in internal politics. In movements, documented dissent can become liability if the archive is raided. Risk mitigation requires clear agreements about *what* gets documented, *who* can see it, and *how long* it's kept.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Mozilla's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):** The Mozilla Firefox team began documenting major architectural choices in structured format—capturing the problem, options considered, chosen solution, and rationale. These were stored as plain-text files in the repository, versioned like code. The pattern broke a cycle where new developers had to reverse-engineer why the codebase looked the way it did. Over time, ADRs became searchable, linked, and referenced in code reviews. When the team faced a new problem, they could ask: "How did we solve something similar?" The pattern created compounding architectural wisdom. It also made it easier to revisit old decisions—when conditions changed, the original reasoning was legible, making intentional change possible rather than accidental drift.

**Black Futures Lab's Participation Infrastructure:** The activist organization, working on democracy and Black political power, systematized how they documented campaign decisions and tactical learning. After each major action, they ran a structured *Rapid Response Documentation* process: a facilitator interviewed key people about what worked, what didn't, and what they'd do differently. This was written up and shared within 48 hours—while the experience was fresh and the learning was actionable for the next campaign. By building documentation into the campaign rhythm (not after), they created a distributed tactical commons. Other movements could adapt their approaches because the reasoning was transparent. Documentation became movement-building infrastructure, not archive work.

**U.S. Digital Service's Playbook:** The federal government unit (created to modernize government digital services) discovered that good practice was locked in individual teams' heads. They systematized it: every completed project produced a *Play*—a short document explaining a specific practice, why it matters, how to do it, and what government agencies had used it successfully. These were published openly online and updated as experience accumulated. The pattern transformed isolated government successes into reusable knowledge. A team in one agency could reference another agency's learning without having to rebuild the relationship. Documentation became the connective tissue binding scattered government practice into something that could be learned and improved collectively.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age where AI systems can index vast documentation instantly, this pattern faces both amplification and peril. AI can *synthesize* documentation—finding patterns across thousands of decision records, flagging contradictions, suggesting which old solutions apply to new problems. This makes good documentation far more generative than before; a well-maintained decision archive becomes a searchable commons of institutional wisdom.

But AI also creates new risks. Large language models trained on poorly-documented work will hallucinate rationale. Teams might trust AI-generated "explanations" of code or decisions more than the humans who made them. Documentation becomes critical precisely because it's the ground truth that corrects AI inference. Without it, machine learning will extrapolate from code alone—generating plausible-sounding but false reasoning.

In tech product contexts specifically: as codebases become larger and change faster, the gap between code and understanding widens. AI can map code structure perfectly; it cannot explain *intent* without documentation. Teams using AI-assisted development (copilots, code generation) face a choice: either document rationales obsessively so the AI learns from intention, or accept that future understanding will be inference from structure alone. This shifts documentation from "nice to have" to foundational infrastructure for human-AI collaboration.

Distributed commons gain new leverage: documentation can be published as open data, making it fodder for collective learning and remixing. An activist movement's campaign playbooks become training data for broader movement infrastructure. Government policy reasoning becomes auditable by citizens. But this requires explicit consent and careful governance—documentation becomes more valuable as commons *and* more vulnerable to misuse.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

New people ask "Where's the documentation?" and find it quickly—not always complete, but answerable. When a problem recurs, someone says "We solved this before; here's the decision and why it matters now." Decisions explicitly reference previous decisions with something like "This reverses our 2021 choice because...the context shifted." Documentation is cited in conversations, not just archived. People update documentation during normal work, treating it as part of the task, not separate. When documentation is read, it changes behavior—people make different choices because they understand the reasoning.

**Signs of decay:**

Documentation exists but nobody reads it; links are stale; dates are old but content is treated as current. New people never ask about documentation because the culture signals "just figure it out." Decisions are remade without checking the archive. Documentation accumulates without pruning—it becomes "too much to search" so people ignore it. A single person or role is responsible for maintaining docs; when they leave, documentation rots. Teams spend more energy *keeping docs consistent* than *learning from them*. Documentation describes "how things are" but not "why they are that way"—it's a snapshot without reasoning.

**When to replant:**

If documentation has become stale and unreliable, don't salvage it incrementally. Instead: pause, declare the archive "archived," and start a new documentation practice with fresh discipline and clearer governance. If you're documenting everything, you're documenting wrong—documentation work becomes unbearable. Restrict to *decisions* (what changed and why), *methods that work* (tested and repeatable), and *rationales that surprised us* (learning that contradicted assumption). Restart when a significant portion of your team is new, when you're entering a new phase of work, or when you realize documentation has stopped feeding practice.
