### 1. Overview

Platform cooperativism is a model for the ownership and governance of internet platforms that is built on cooperative principles. It presents a democratically-oriented alternative to the venture capital-funded, profit-driven model of the gig economy, often referred to as platform capitalism. A platform cooperative, or platform co-op, is a digital platform—a website or mobile app—that is collectively owned and controlled by its members, who can be workers, users, producers, consumers, or other stakeholders. This model aims to create a more equitable and fair digital economy by prioritizing shared value, democratic control, and social and ecological sustainability over the extraction of profit for a small number of shareholders.

The core problem that platform cooperativism addresses is the exploitative nature of many popular online platforms, which often rely on precarious labor, evade regulations, and extract value from communities without providing long-term benefits. By contrast, platform co-ops are designed to serve the needs of their members and communities, rather than to maximize returns for investors. This approach fosters a more just and sustainable digital ecosystem where workers have a voice in their working conditions and a share in the value they create.

The concept of platform cooperativism was first articulated by Trebor Scholz, a scholar at The New School, in his 2014 article "Platform Cooperativism vs. the Sharing Economy." Scholz, along with journalist Nathan Schneider, helped to popularize the idea through a series of publications, conferences, and advocacy efforts. The movement emerged as a critique of the so-called "sharing economy" and its associated platforms like Uber and Airbnb, which, despite their rhetoric of sharing and community, often operate in ways that are detrimental to workers and local economies. Platform cooperativism draws on the long history of the cooperative movement, adapting its principles to the context of the digital age.

### 2. Core Principles

Platform cooperativism is guided by a set of core principles that distinguish it from the conventional, profit-driven platform economy. These principles, largely based on the work of Trebor Scholz and other advocates, are designed to ensure that platform co-ops are democratic, equitable, and sustainable. The cornerstone of the model is **collective ownership**, which dictates that the platforms themselves should be owned and controlled by the people who create the value, including workers, users, and other stakeholders. This ensures that the platform serves the interests of its members rather than distant shareholders.

Another key principle is the commitment to **decent pay and income security**. Platform co-ops strive to provide fair compensation, including a living wage and benefits, creating a stable economic environment for all participants. This is complemented by the principles of **transparency and data portability**, which grant members the right to understand how the platform is governed and how their data is used, as well as the ability to take their data with them if they leave. The model also emphasizes **appreciation and acknowledgment**, fostering a culture of mutual respect that is often absent in the gig economy.

Democratic governance is operationalized through the principle of **co-determined work and governance**, where members have a direct say in the decisions that affect them, from working conditions to platform policies. To support this, the movement advocates for **a protective legal framework** that recognizes and protects the cooperative model. Finally, in an economy characterized by precarious work, the principle of **portable worker protections and benefits** is crucial, with platform co-ops playing a role in creating and supporting such systems.

### 3. Key Practices

Platform cooperatives are put into practice through a variety of methods and approaches that reflect their cooperative identity. A common practice is to **build on existing cooperative structures**, collaborating with established mutual aid networks to leverage their community norms and trust. The formation of a **small, cross-functional core team** of three to six individuals with complementary skills is also a key practice for initiating a platform co-op. This team is responsible for guiding the project and ensuring it stays true to its mission.

The implementation of **democratic governance structures** is central to platform cooperativism, with member-elected steering committees and open working groups ensuring accountability. Many co-ops also **adopt a lean and iterative approach to development**, starting with a minimum viable product (MVP) and then expanding based on member feedback. This is often complemented by a strong emphasis on **community organizing**, with events and workshops designed to foster a sense of shared ownership and purpose.

To ensure long-term viability, platform co-ops must **develop a sustainable funding model** that does not rely on venture capital. This often involves a mix of membership fees, community shares, and grants. The commitment to **fair labor practices**, including fair wages and benefits, is a direct response to the exploitation prevalent in the gig economy. Finally, the practice of **promoting transparency and openness** in all aspects of the cooperative, from finances to decision-making, is essential for building trust and reinforcing democratic principles.

### 4. Application Context

Platform cooperativism is a versatile model that can be applied in various contexts where the current platform economy has created inequities. It is particularly well-suited for **worker-owned service platforms** in sectors like ride-sharing and food delivery, as well as for **creative and freelancer collectives** that enable artists and journalists to control the distribution of their work. The model is also effective for creating **community-based marketplaces** that strengthen local economies, and for establishing **data cooperatives** that give users control over their personal data. Furthermore, it has been successfully applied to **social care and support networks**, where the focus is on quality of care rather than profit.

However, the model is not a universal solution. It is generally **not suitable for hyper-growth, venture-backed startups** due to its incompatibility with the rapid-growth expectations of venture capitalists. It is also less appropriate for businesses that require **centralized command and control** for rapid decision-making.

Platform cooperativism is a scalable model that can be implemented at the **Team, Department, Organization, Multi-Organization, and Ecosystem** levels. Its fractal nature allows its core principles to be applied consistently across different scales. The model is being applied in a growing number of domains, including **Transportation and Logistics, Hospitality and Tourism, Creative Industries, Social and Health Care, News and Media, Retail and E-commerce, and Data and Technology**.

### 5. Implementation

Implementing a platform cooperative requires careful planning, community engagement, and a commitment to cooperative principles. Key **prerequisites** include a clear vision and mission, a committed core team with a diverse range of skills, and deep community engagement from the outset. The process of **getting started** typically involves forming a core team, connecting with the broader cooperative ecosystem for support, and developing a solid business plan and funding strategy. It is also advisable to start with a minimum viable platform (MVP) to test assumptions and gather feedback before scaling up. Finally, working with legal professionals to incorporate and establish a democratic governance structure is a critical step.

Platform cooperatives face several **common challenges**, including limited access to capital, stiff competition from well-funded incumbents, the technical complexity of building and maintaining a platform, and a complex legal and regulatory landscape. To overcome these challenges, platform co-ops must focus on a number of **success factors**. These include building a strong and engaged community, offering a clear and compelling value proposition, developing a sustainable business model, and maintaining a steadfast commitment to cooperative principles.

### 6. Evidence & Impact

While still a nascent movement, platform cooperativism has demonstrated its potential to create a more equitable digital economy. There are a number of **notable adopters** of the model, including **Stocksy United**, a successful artist-owned stock photography cooperative; **Fairmondo**, a German-based cooperative alternative to Amazon; and **Green Taxi Cooperative**, a driver-owned taxi co-op in Denver that has competed effectively with Uber and Lyft. Other examples include **Up & Go**, a worker-owned home services platform in New York City; **Eva**, a ride-sharing cooperative in Montreal; and **CoopCycle**, a federation of bike delivery co-ops.

The **documented outcomes** of platform cooperativism are promising. Research has shown that the model can lead to **improved wages and working conditions**, as well as **increased worker control and empowerment**. By giving workers a stake in the platform, co-ops can foster a more engaged and productive workforce. Furthermore, platform cooperatives contribute to **greater economic democracy** and **stronger local economies** by keeping value within the community.

The movement is supported by a growing body of **research and advocacy**. **The Platform Cooperativism Consortium (PCC)** at The New School is a leading organization in the field, and foundational texts like **"Ours to Hack and to Own"** have helped to shape the movement. A growing body of **academic research** is also contributing to a more robust evidence base for the model.

### 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation presents both opportunities and challenges for platform cooperativism. The **cognitive augmentation potential** of AI is significant, as it can be used to enhance efficiency, personalize services, improve democratic governance, and generate data-driven insights for social impact. However, it is crucial to maintain a healthy **human-machine balance**. While AI can automate many tasks, the uniquely human elements of trust, community, and ethical decision-making must be protected. To this end, it is essential to involve members in the co-design of AI systems and to invest in the social infrastructure of the cooperative.

The **evolution outlook** for platform cooperativism in the cognitive era is promising. We may see the rise of **“Cooperative AI,”** a new form of cooperativism focused on the collective ownership and governance of AI systems. **Data cooperatives** could also become a key building block for a more democratic AI ecosystem. Ultimately, by embracing the principles of cooperativism, we can create a more pluralistic and resilient digital economy that is not dependent on a small number of dominant platforms.

### 8. Commons Alignment Assessment (v2.0)

This assessment evaluates the pattern based on the Commons OS v2.0 framework, which focuses on the pattern's ability to enable resilient collective value creation.

**1. Stakeholder Architecture:**
Platform Cooperativism fundamentally re-architects stakeholder relationships by defining Rights and Responsibilities across a broad spectrum of participants, including workers, users, and producers. It moves beyond a shareholder-centric model to a multi-stakeholder framework where members collectively own and govern the platform. This structure inherently embeds the principle that those who create value should have a say in its governance and a share in its benefits.

**2. Value Creation Capability:**
The pattern explicitly enables collective value creation that extends far beyond economic output. It prioritizes social value through decent pay and income security, ecological value by fostering sustainable business practices, and knowledge value through transparency and data portability. By focusing on the needs of its members rather than profit maximization, Platform Cooperativism cultivates a richer, more diverse value-creation ecosystem.

**3. Resilience & Adaptability:**
Platform Cooperativism is designed to help systems adapt to complexity and maintain coherence under stress by fostering a strong sense of community and shared purpose. The model's emphasis on a lean and iterative approach to development allows for continuous adaptation based on member feedback. However, its resilience is often tested by the challenge of competing with heavily-funded incumbents in the market.

**4. Ownership Architecture:**
The pattern redefines ownership as a set of Rights and Responsibilities rather than just monetary equity. The principle of "one member, one vote" ensures that ownership is tied to participation and contribution, not capital investment. This democratic approach to ownership is a cornerstone of the model, ensuring that the platform serves the interests of its members.

**5. Design for Autonomy:**
Platform Cooperativism is highly compatible with AI, DAOs, and other distributed systems. The potential for "Cooperative AI" and "Data Cooperatives" demonstrates the model's forward-looking design. Its decentralized governance and emphasis on member control align well with the principles of autonomy and low coordination overhead, making it a suitable framework for the future of work.

**6. Composability & Interoperability:**
The model is designed for composability, allowing it to combine with other patterns to build larger value-creation systems. The existence of federations like CoopCycle, which unites various bike delivery co-ops, showcases its ability to interoperate and scale. This modularity enables the creation of a resilient and interconnected ecosystem of cooperative platforms.

**7. Fractal Value Creation:**
The value-creation logic of Platform Cooperativism is inherently fractal, applying at multiple scales from small teams to large, multi-organizational ecosystems. The core principles of democratic governance and collective ownership can be implemented consistently, whether in a local food delivery co-op or an international federation of freelance platforms. This scalability is a key strength of the model.

**Overall Score: 4 (Value Creation Enabler)**

**Rationale:**
Platform Cooperativism is a powerful framework for enabling collective value creation. It provides a robust architecture for distributing Rights and Responsibilities, fostering a multi-faceted value ecosystem, and ensuring democratic governance. While it faces challenges in competing with established platform monopolies, its foundational principles are strongly aligned with the creation of a more resilient and equitable digital commons.

**Opportunities for Improvement:**
- Develop innovative funding models that can provide the necessary capital for growth without compromising cooperative principles.
- Strengthen the legal and regulatory frameworks to better support the unique needs of platform cooperatives.
- Foster greater public awareness and understanding of the benefits of Platform Cooperativism to drive wider adoption.
