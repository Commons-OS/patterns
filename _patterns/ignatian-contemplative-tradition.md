### Section 1: Context

Intrapreneurs in established organizations face a peculiar exhaustion: they carry visionary intent within systems designed for incremental execution. In corporations, they navigate between shareholder return and human flourishing. In government, between bureaucratic process and citizen emergence. In activist movements, between urgency and relational depth. In product teams, between feature velocity and user meaning-making. 

The commons here is fragile. People bring whole selves—imagination, intuition, spiritual hunger—into systems that measure only what's legible and controllable. Contemplative traditions offer an alternative: attention practices that honor the invisible work of discernment, the felt dimensions of collective choosing, the presence that deepens before action.

Ignatian practice is particularly suited to this because it doesn't retreat from institutional life. The Jesuits built it inside power structures—courts, universities, companies. It asks: where is divine presence *within* this tense situation? What is the system genuinely trying to become? This makes it a pattern for people stewarding change from inside, not outside.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Ignatian vs. Tradition.**

The tension surfaces as a collision between two ways of knowing. 

Ignatian contemplative practice is radically inductive: it begins with concrete felt experience—the flutter in the chest, the image that won't leave, the conversation that shifted something unnamed. From that felt ground, it moves toward meaning and discernment. It trusts emotion as data. It expects God (or the system's emergent intelligence) to speak through particularity, not abstraction.

Institutional tradition, by contrast, often runs deductively. It has doctrine, protocol, precedent. It values consistency, repeatability, institutional memory. It suspects emotion as unreliable noise. It asks practitioners to subordinate personal experience to established frameworks.

When unresolved, this breaks discernment. Teams deploy contemplative language—*feeling-driven*, *intuitive wisdom*—while actually running predetermined decisions past feeling as rubber stamp. Or they swing the other way: abandoning all structure in the name of authenticity, generating chaos that fragments the commons.

For intrapreneurs, this is acute. They're holding both: visionary intuition *and* responsibility to institutional health. Without this pattern, they either become spiritual lone wolves (losing organizational traction) or organizational functionaries (losing soul). The commons withers from the inside out.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, establish a contemplative discernment cycle rooted in the Ignatian examen adapted to collective decision-making, where practitioners attend to feelings and imaginative pulls *within* institutional constraints, using felt response as a voice in the commons, not a veto.**

The mechanism here is permission. Ignatian practice, adapted to the commons, gives institutional practitioners explicit license to treat emotion, intuition, and imagination as legitimate data—not supplementary, not soft, but core to how a system learns what it's becoming.

The examen (literally, examination) is the fundamental Ignatian tool: a structured review of lived experience. Practitioners notice where they felt alive, where they felt depleted, where something stirred recognition. In a commons, this becomes collective: *Where did we feel aliveness in this initiative? Where did we sense contraction? What images or questions won't release us?*

This shift is subtle but vital. You're not abandoning institutional structure; you're feeding institutional wisdom through the body. Systems have felt sense—tension in relationships, heaviness in meetings, sparks when the right people connect. Ignatian practice makes that felt sense explicit and actionable.

The pattern resolves the tension by reframing emotion not as subjective distortion but as *the system speaking in real time*. When a meeting feels hollow despite clean process, the hollowness is data: something in the commons is misaligned with its actual purpose. The Ignatian move is to slow down, attend, and ask: what is this feeling revealing?

This creates adaptive capacity. Tradition provides structure; Ignatian attention prevents that structure from ossifying. The commons stays alive because it can hear itself.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**1. Install a monthly contemplative review cycle.** Gather the commons (full team or rotating representatives) for 90 minutes. First 20 minutes: silent individual examen using a written prompt—*Where did I notice aliveness this month? Where contraction? What image or question carries weight?* Second 30 minutes: small groups (3–4) share without fixing or explaining. Third 30 minutes: whole-group listening for patterns and emerging questions. No action items. The output is collective felt sense, spoken aloud, that informs future decisions.

**For corporate settings:** Embed this in quarterly business reviews alongside financials. Frame it as "Organizational Health Sensing." Leadership attends without dominating conversation; they listen for signals of engagement, burnout, misalignment that KPIs don't capture.

**2. Create a discernment threshold for significant decisions.** Before major choices, ask: Have we created space for contemplative attention? Have we named what we're actually afraid of, hoping for? In product teams, this means: before architecture decisions, spend an hour in Ignatian dialogue about what the product is *becoming* beyond the feature list. Let engineers, designers, and users sit with the imaginative pull of the thing itself.

**For tech contexts:** Use this to prevent premature optimization. Contemplative attention often surfaces that a team is solving a feature when the system is asking for a different kind of presence.

**3. Train practitioners in the Ignatian movements: Noticing, Savoring, and Asking.** 

- *Noticing*: What actually happened? Stay close to sensory and emotional detail—not interpretation yet.
- *Savoring*: Where did this sit in your body? What texture, color, or quality does it carry?
- *Asking*: What is this inviting? What is breaking? What wants to be born?

**For government and activist contexts:** This is radical because it requires that contemplative attention operate *alongside* accountability and urgency. An activist group practicing Ignatian discernment doesn't slow action; it clarifies whether the action is aligned with the system's deepest intention. A public service team uses it to catch misalignment between stated mission and actual practice before it calcifies.

**4. Name the tension explicitly in your commons charter.** Write into your operating agreements: *We honor both rigorous institutional structure and the felt wisdom of practitioners. We treat emotion as intelligent signal. We will slow down to attend when something feels misaligned.* This prevents the pattern from becoming either touchy-feely theater or spiritual bypassing of real conflict.

**For corporate and government:** Protect contemplative time from efficiency metrics. Don't ask "what was the ROI of that examen cycle?" Instead: Did it surface blindspots? Did it deepen relational trust? Did it prevent a costly misalignment?

---

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

The commons develops **discernment capacity**—the ability to sense what's true and alive in a situation, not just what's logically defensible. People stop defaulting to hierarchy or consensus theater and instead trust their own attention. This generates **psychological safety**: if emotion is legitimate data, people can be honest about fear, hope, and intuition without posturing.

A **relational thickness** builds. Sitting in contemplative attention together creates bonds that survive conflict. Teams become less brittle; they can hold paradox without fracturing.

**Resilience increases** because the commons can adapt faster. It catches misalignment early through felt sense rather than waiting for metrics to show damage.

---

**What risks emerge:**

**Decay into spiritual theater** is the primary risk. The examen becomes a checkbox, contemplative language becomes jargon, and the system still runs by hidden power. This is why the pattern scores resilience at 3.0—without genuine commitment to listening, it's merely aesthetic.

**Emotion weaponization**: when feeling becomes data, skilled manipulators can use emotional narrative to obscure material facts. An institutional actor with high emotional intelligence can frame selfish decisions in the language of authenticity.

**Rigidification through repetition**: if the practice becomes routinized ("we always do examen on Thursdays"), it loses vitality. The system can become locked into its own past patterns, *feeling* alive while actually stagnating. The vitality_reasoning flags this precisely: the pattern sustains existing health but doesn't generate adaptive capacity if it hardens into habit.

**Insufficient ownership clarity** (ownership score: 3.0): contemplative discernment can obscure who actually decides. If every decision gets filtered through feeling-sense, accountability can diffuse. You need clear co-ownership structures *alongside* contemplative practice, not instead of them.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Jesuit Management Innovation—1950s–1970s:** The Jesuits adapted examen into organizational practice when leading universities and schools. Pedro Arrupe, the Superior General, instituted monthly discernment gatherings where Jesuit leaders across institutions shared what they were noticing—where the church's actual practice aligned or clashed with its stated mission. This wasn't therapy; it was *institutional sense-making*. The practice created horizontal accountability: leaders could name blindspots without shame, and the order adapted faster to social upheaval. By the 1970s, this had shaped Jesuit education to prioritize social justice—not from top-down mandate but from collective attention to where the institution was being called.

**Center for Courage & Renewal (Parker Palmer, 1993–present):** Palmer brought Ignatian examen into secular institutional work, specifically for educators and leaders carrying contemplative tradition into bureaucratic systems. They use circles of trust—small groups practicing deep listening and examen-like reflection on professional experience. A superintendent in a struggling school district joined a circle. Within months, she began applying the practice internally: monthly gatherings where teachers shared not just curriculum concerns but what they were noticing about student aliveness, their own burnout, the gap between mission and practice. This surfaced that the district's discipline policies were operating at odds with its stated commitment to belonging. The contemplative attention didn't solve the policy problem directly—but it unified the commons around a real question, creating alignment. Change followed.

**Product teams at Patagonia (2010s–present):** Before major product decisions, Patagonia product leads practice what they call "values-examen": sitting with a product concept and asking—Where is this coming from? What are we actually making possible? Is this aligned with our intent as a commons? Engineers report that this practice *accelerated* better decisions because it prevented the team from building features no one actually needed. The contemplative attention served efficiency by clarifying purpose before execution. One example: a materials innovation that looked promising on paper sparked discomfort in the room—something about the extraction story didn't sit right. The team slowed, sat with it, and discovered the supply chain carried hidden environmental cost that metrics had missed. Contemplative attention caught what analysis missed.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age of AI and distributed intelligence, Ignatian practice becomes *more* necessary and more complex.

AI systems excel at pattern-matching and optimization *within existing parameters*. They can't ask what the parameters should be. That's the Ignatian question: what is this system becoming? What is trying to emerge? AI generates vast option-spaces; humans must feel their way toward the right constellation of choices.

But here's the risk: **AI can simulate Ignatian language without the practice.** A system trained on millions of spiritual texts can generate contemplative-sounding guidance that carries no actual presence. For commons stewarding technology, this demands rigor. You can't outsource discernment to a language model and call it Ignatian practice. You must teach the commons to distinguish between *genuine contemplative attention* (slow, felt, rooted in embodied experience) and *contemplative mimicry* (fast, algorithmic, appearing wise).

**New leverage emerges:** Distributed AI can hold and process the felt data the commons generates. A team practices examen; someone records the patterns of aliveness and contraction across cycles. An AI system can help identify meta-patterns—*across twelve examen cycles, we consistently felt alive when X was present, contracted when Y happened.* This amplifies the commons' capacity to learn from its own felt sense without replacing human discernment.

**For product teams specifically:** The Ignatian question—*What is this trying to become?*—becomes urgent when AI is in the system. A product with embedded AI needs contemplative stewardship precisely because the system's behavior can drift from intention. Regular examen helps the team notice: Is the AI operating in alignment with what we meant to make? Where has it drifted?

The risk: without contemplative grounding, teams deploying AI drift toward pure functionality. The pattern protects against that drift by keeping the commons' felt sense *central* to how the system evolves.

---

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

1. **Practitioners surface real tensions in meetings.** People name what they're actually worried about, what they're hoping for, without filtering for acceptability. Conversations get specific: *I felt alive when X happened because it meant Y.* Not vague, not performative—felt and present.

2. **Decisions hold across time.** When a commons makes choices rooted in genuine discernment (not just consensus theater), those choices tend to stick. People remain aligned even when circumstances change, because the underlying intention is clear.

3. **The commons visibly relaxes.** Hypervigilance decreases. People stop constantly proving their worth or managing perception. They trust that their genuine experience matters.

4. **Blind spots surface early.** The commons catches misalignment between stated mission and actual practice before it hardens into culture. A team using examen notices: we say we value sustainability but pressure for speed overrides it. They can adjust before the contradiction becomes identity.

---

**Signs of decay:**

1. **Examen becomes obligatory.** People show up, share rehearsed reflections, nothing shifts. The contemplative space becomes another compliance box. Listen for: flat affect, short shares, people checking the time.

2. **Emotion gets used as trump card.** Someone's feeling becomes permission to override evidence or accountability. *I feel this isn't right,* stops all questioning. The commons loses its capacity to hold both feeling and fact.

3. **Decisions still run on hidden power.** Contemplative process happens, but leadership has already decided. The examen feels like theater to build buy-in for predetermined outcomes. The commons senses the inauthenticity and retreats.

4. **The practice hardens into ritual without renewal.** *We always do examen this way because we've always done examen this way.* The container becomes more important than what it holds. Vitality drains into habit.

---

**When to replant:**

If you notice decay, **pause the regular cycle and do a contemplative audit.** Gather the commons and ask: *Where did we lose authenticity in this practice? What are we defending instead of attending to?* Often, replanting means changing the form—new prompts, different timing, different group composition—while holding the intention of genuine attention.

**Replant also when the commons faces genuine adaptive pressure** (major strategic shift, new external threat, leadership change). This is when contemplative discernment has the most power: the commons can sense its way into the new territory together, rather than fragmenting into individual survival responses.
