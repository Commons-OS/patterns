## 1. Overview

Policy Governance, often referred to as the Carver model, is a system for organizational governance created by Dr. John Carver in the 1970s. It provides a comprehensive framework that defines and clarifies the roles and responsibilities of a governing board and its relationship with the organization's chief executive officer (CEO). The model is designed to empower boards to lead their organizations effectively by focusing on the larger issues of purpose, vision, and long-term outcomes, which Carver terms "Ends." This approach contrasts with traditional governance models where boards often become entangled in the operational details of the organization, or the "Means."

The primary problem that Policy Governance seeks to solve is the common struggle boards face in providing effective leadership without micromanaging the staff. By establishing a clear distinction between the board's responsibility for setting the organization's direction and the CEO's responsibility for managing the organization to achieve that direction, the model aims to create a more efficient, accountable, and strategic system of governance. The origin of the model lies in Carver's extensive experience and research into why boards, despite the best intentions of their members, often fail to provide the visionary leadership their organizations need. He developed Policy Governance as a practical, principle-based solution to this widespread challenge, offering a structured approach that can be adapted to various types of organizations, including non-profits, public bodies, and corporations.

## 2. Core Principles

The Policy Governance model is built upon a foundation of ten core principles that work together as an integrated system. These principles are designed to ensure that the board provides effective leadership and maintains accountability for the organization's performance. The principles are as follows:

1.  **The Trust in Trusteeship:** The board acts as the trustee on behalf of the organization's "owners." These owners can be legal shareholders in a for-profit company or the moral and legal owners in a non-profit or public organization. The board's primary allegiance is to these owners, and it is responsible for representing their interests.

2.  **The Board Speaks with One Voice:** The board is a single corporate entity, and its authority is exercised as a whole. Individual board members do not have the authority to direct the CEO or staff. Decisions and policies are made by the board as a group, and the board communicates its official positions with a single voice.

3.  **Board Decisions Should Predominantly Be Policy Decisions:** The board's primary role is to govern through the creation of policies. These policies define the organization's purpose, values, and the boundaries within which the CEO and staff must operate. The board should focus on these high-level policy decisions rather than getting involved in the day-to-day management of the organization.

4.  **Board Should Formulate Policy by Determining the Broadest Values Before Progressing to More Narrow Ones:** The board should start by defining the broadest values and perspectives related to the organization's Ends and Means. It then moves to progressively more detailed policies as needed, stopping when it can accept any reasonable interpretation of its policies by the CEO.

5.  **A Board Should Define and Delegate, Rather Than React and Ratify:** Instead of reacting to staff proposals or ratifying decisions already made, the board should proactively define its expectations and delegate the authority to the CEO to achieve them. This allows the board to lead from the front and empowers the CEO to manage effectively.

6.  **Ends Determination is the Pivotal Duty of Governance:** The most important responsibility of the board is to determine the organization's "Ends." Ends are the results the organization is expected to achieve, for whom, and at what cost. The board's focus on Ends ensures that the organization is making a meaningful impact and fulfilling its purpose.

7.  **The Board's Best Control Over Staff Means is to Limit, Not Prescribe:** The board should control the "Means" (the methods and practices used to achieve the Ends) by setting clear limitations on what is unacceptable. By defining what the CEO *cannot* do, the board gives the CEO the freedom and flexibility to use any reasonable means to achieve the Ends.

8.  **A Board Must Explicitly Design its Own Products and Process:** The board is responsible for designing its own governance process and products. This includes defining its own roles, responsibilities, and how it will function as a governing body. This self-discipline ensures that the board operates effectively and efficiently.

9.  **A Board Must Forge a Linkage with Management That is Both Empowering and Safe:** The board must create a clear and respectful relationship with the CEO. This relationship should be empowering, giving the CEO the authority and support needed to succeed, while also being safe, with clear accountability and monitoring mechanisms in place.

10. **Performance of the CEO Must Be Monitored Rigorously, but Only Against Policy Criteria:** The board is responsible for monitoring the CEO's performance to ensure that the organization is achieving its Ends and operating within the established Executive Limitations. This monitoring should be based on the board's pre-stated policies, providing a clear and objective basis for evaluation.

## 3. Key Practices

The Policy Governance model is put into practice through a set of key activities that enable the board to effectively govern the organization. These practices are designed to be systematic and disciplined, ensuring that the board's focus remains on strategic leadership and accountability.

1.  **Developing Ends Policies:** This is the cornerstone of the Carver model. The board engages in a deliberative process to define the organization's "Ends." This involves answering fundamental questions about the organization's purpose: What results should the organization achieve? For whom should these results be achieved? What is the relative worth or priority of these results? The outcome of this practice is a set of clear, written policies that articulate the organization's reason for existence and its intended impact on the world. For example, a literacy non-profit's Ends policy might state: "Every child in our community will have the literacy skills to succeed in school and in life, at a cost that does not exceed our annual budget."

2.  **Establishing Executive Limitations Policies:** Once the Ends are defined, the board establishes "Executive Limitations" policies. These policies define the boundaries of acceptable means that the CEO can use to achieve the Ends. Instead of prescribing specific actions, the board prohibits actions that would be imprudent, unethical, or illegal. This practice empowers the CEO with the freedom to manage the organization and innovate within a set of clear constraints. For instance, an Executive Limitations policy might state: "The CEO shall not cause or allow any financial expenditure that exceeds the board-approved budget."

3.  **Clarifying Board-Management Delegation:** The board formally delegates the authority to achieve the Ends to the CEO through a clear and explicit process. This delegation is documented in the board's policies, typically in a section on Board-Management Delegation. This practice ensures that there is no ambiguity about the CEO's authority and responsibility. It also clarifies the singular point of connection between the board and the staff, which is through the CEO.

4.  **Defining the Governance Process:** The board applies the same level of discipline to its own operations as it does to the organization's management. It develops "Governance Process" policies that define how the board will function, including its roles, responsibilities, meeting procedures, and how it will hold itself accountable. This practice ensures that the board operates in a professional and effective manner. For example, a Governance Process policy might outline the board's annual agenda, ensuring that it dedicates sufficient time to its key responsibilities, such as Ends development and monitoring.

5.  **Monitoring Organizational Performance:** The board systematically monitors the organization's performance to ensure that it is achieving the Ends and operating within the Executive Limitations. This is not a haphazard process but a structured one, based on the board's pre-stated policies. The CEO is required to provide regular monitoring reports that demonstrate compliance with the board's policies. The board then assesses these reports to determine if the CEO's interpretation of the policies is reasonable and if the data presented is credible. This practice provides the basis for the board's evaluation of the CEO's performance and ensures accountability.

## 4. Application Context

The Carver Policy Governance model is a versatile framework that can be adapted to a wide range of organizations. However, its effectiveness can vary depending on the specific context, culture, and needs of the organization.

**Best Used For:**

*   **Non-profit organizations:** The model is particularly well-suited for non-profits that are seeking to clarify the roles of the board and staff, and to focus on their mission and long-term impact.
*   **Public sector entities:** Government agencies, school boards, and other public bodies can benefit from the model's emphasis on accountability to the public and its clear framework for decision-making.
*   **Membership associations:** Associations and other member-based organizations can use the model to ensure that the board is responsive to the needs and interests of its members.
*   **Organizations with a clear mission and purpose:** The model is most effective in organizations that have a clear sense of their "Ends" or ultimate purpose. This allows the board to focus on high-level policy-making and to delegate the means of achieving the mission to the CEO.
*   **Boards that are committed to strategic leadership:** The model is designed for boards that want to move beyond the traditional role of overseeing operations and to become true strategic leaders for their organizations.

**Not Suitable For:**

*   **Early-stage startups:** In the early stages of a startup, the lines between governance and management are often blurred, and the board may need to be more hands-on in the day-to-day operations of the company. The strict separation of roles in the Carver model may be too rigid for this environment.
*   **Organizations in crisis:** During a crisis, the board may need to take a more active role in managing the organization and making operational decisions. The Carver model's emphasis on delegation may not be appropriate in these situations.
*   **Organizations with a weak or inexperienced CEO:** The model relies on a high degree of trust and confidence in the CEO. If the CEO is weak or inexperienced, the board may be reluctant to delegate the level of authority required by the model.

**Scale:**

The Policy Governance model can be applied to organizations of all sizes, from small community-based non-profits to large multi-national corporations. The principles of the model are scalable and can be adapted to the specific needs and complexity of the organization.

**Domains:**

The Carver model has been successfully implemented in a wide range of domains, including:

*   **Healthcare:** Hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare organizations have used the model to improve their governance and to focus on patient outcomes.
*   **Education:** School boards, universities, and other educational institutions have adopted the model to enhance their strategic leadership and accountability.
*   **Social services:** Non-profit organizations providing social services have used the model to clarify their mission and to improve their effectiveness.
*   **Arts and culture:** Museums, theaters, and other cultural organizations have implemented the model to strengthen their governance and to ensure their long-term sustainability.
## 5. Implementation

Implementing Policy Governance is a significant undertaking requiring commitment from the board and CEO. It is a long-term investment in improving governance.

**Prerequisites:**

*   **Board and CEO Buy-in:** Full support and commitment from the board and CEO are critical.
*   **Understanding of the Model:** A thorough understanding of the model's principles and practices is necessary.
*   **Willingness to Change:** Board members must be willing to embrace a new way of governing.

**Getting Started:**

1.  **Educate the Board and CEO:** Educate the board and CEO about the model through workshops, retreats, and reading materials.
2.  **Make a Formal Decision to Adopt the Model:** Formally decide to adopt the model and document it in the board's minutes.
3.  **Develop the Policy Manual:** Collaboratively develop the four sets of policies: Ends, Executive Limitations, Board-Management Delegation, and Governance Process.
4.  **"Flip the Switch":** Formally adopt the policy manual and begin operating according to the new governance system.
5.  **Monitor and Refine:** Regularly monitor performance and refine policies and practices as needed.

**Common Challenges:**

*   **Resistance to Change:** Overcoming resistance to change from board members and staff.
*   **Lack of Understanding:** Ensuring a clear understanding of the model to avoid implementation struggles.
*   **Difficulty in Developing Ends Policies:** The challenge of developing clear and measurable Ends policies.
*   **Micromanagement by the Board:** Avoiding the temptation for the board to micromanage the CEO.

**Success Factors:**

*   **Strong Leadership:** Strong leadership from the board chair and the CEO is essential.
*   **Patience and Perseverance:** A long-term commitment to the implementation process.
*   **External Support:** The value of working with an experienced Policy Governance consultant.
*   **Continuous Learning:** A commitment to ongoing learning about the model.

## 6. Evidence & Impact

The Policy Governance model has been adopted by a wide range of organizations globally, with a growing body of evidence supporting its effectiveness. While rigorous academic research is still emerging, anecdotal evidence from implementing organizations is largely positive.

**Notable Adopters:**

The Carver model has been adopted by diverse organizations, including:

*   **Adams 12 Five Star District:** A large Colorado school district that reported increased board confidence and a more motivated CEO.
*   **Saskatchewan Registered Nurses Association (SRNA):** Used the model to focus nursing education on relevant competencies.
*   **Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver:** Improved the quality of its board decisions.
*   **Thames Valley Children's Centre:** A Canadian organization that improved board-management dialogue.
*   **AIDS New Brunswick:** Clarified roles, freed up board time for strategic issues, and improved accountability.
*   **Hawkesbury and District General Hospital:** A Canadian hospital that found the model's benefits outweighed implementation challenges.
*   **Meridian Township, Michigan:** A local government that became more efficient and achieved strategic goals.
*   **The State Bar of California:** The board of governors focused on policy benefiting the judicial system.
*   **Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA):** Many UU congregations have adopted the model to improve governance.

**Documented Outcomes:**

Implementing organizations have reported positive outcomes, including:

*   **Improved Board Performance:** Greater clarity of role and focus on strategic issues.
*   **Increased CEO Empowerment and Accountability:** CEOs have the freedom to manage within clear boundaries.
*   **More Efficient and Productive Meetings:** Board meetings are more focused and productive.
*   **Clearer Communication and a Stronger Board-CEO Relationship:** A clear framework for communication and a more positive relationship.
*   **Greater Focus on Mission and Long-Term Impact:** A greater focus on the organization's "Ends" and long-term impact.

**Research Support:**

While much evidence is anecdotal, research is growing. A study by Williams (2010) on a women's human service non-profit found positive changes, including a more strategic board. More research is needed to fully understand the model's impact on organizational performance.

## 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

The Carver Policy Governance model, developed in the industrial era, remains relevant in the cognitive era. Its emphasis on clear roles, strategic foresight, and data-driven monitoring can be enhanced by AI and automation.

**Cognitive Augmentation Potential:**

AI and automation can augment the model by:

*   **Enhanced Monitoring and Data Analysis:** Automating data collection and analysis for monitoring reports, providing more timely and accurate information.
*   **Improved Strategic Foresight:** Analyzing large datasets to identify emerging trends and patterns, helping the board to be more proactive.
*   **Streamlined Policy Management:** Managing the board's policy manual, ensuring it is up-to-date and accessible.
*   **More Efficient Meetings:** Automating the creation of meeting agendas, minutes, and action items.

**Human-Machine Balance:**

AI and automation are not a substitute for human judgment. The board's role in setting Ends, making ethical decisions, and building relationships remains uniquely human. The key is to balance human and machine, using technology to augment the board's capabilities.

**Evolution Outlook:**

The model is likely to evolve with:

*   **Greater Emphasis on Data and Analytics:** Boards will need to be more data-savvy.
*   **More Dynamic and Adaptive Policies:** Policies will need to be more dynamic and adaptive.
*   **Increased Focus on Cybersecurity and Data Privacy:** Greater attention to the risks of cybersecurity and data privacy.
*   **New Forms of Stakeholder Engagement:** New opportunities for boards to engage with stakeholders.

By embracing the opportunities of the cognitive era, boards can use the Policy Governance model to become more effective, strategic, and accountable leaders for their organizations.

## 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

The Carver Policy Governance model, while not explicitly designed as a commons-based framework, exhibits several characteristics that align with the principles of a commons. This assessment examines the model against the seven dimensions of commons alignment.

**1. Stakeholder Mapping:** The Carver model's emphasis on identifying and representing the "owners" of the organization is a form of stakeholder mapping. However, its focus on a single group of "owners" may not be as comprehensive as a full stakeholder mapping process that considers all parties who are affected by the organization's activities.

**2. Value Creation:** The model's focus on "Ends" is a powerful mechanism for value creation. By clearly defining the results that the organization is to achieve, for whom, and at what cost, the model ensures that the organization is focused on creating value for its owners. However, the model's definition of value is primarily focused on the owners, and it may not explicitly consider the value created for other stakeholders.

**3. Value Preservation:** The Policy Governance model has several features that contribute to value preservation. The model's emphasis on monitoring and accountability helps to ensure that the organization is using its resources effectively. The model's focus on long-term Ends also helps to ensure that the organization is sustainable. However, the model does not explicitly address the issue of environmental sustainability or the preservation of other forms of common-pool resources.

**4. Shared Rights & Responsibilities:** The Carver model provides a clear framework for distributing rights and responsibilities between the board and the CEO. This clear division of labor helps to ensure that both the board and the CEO are accountable for their respective roles. However, the model does not explicitly address the rights and responsibilities of other stakeholders.

**5. Systematic Design:** The Policy Governance model is a highly systematic and disciplined approach to governance. This systematic design helps to ensure that the board operates in a consistent and predictable manner, which can increase trust and confidence among stakeholders. However, the model's rigidity can also be a drawback, as it may not be flexible enough to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances.

**6. Systems of Systems:** The Carver model is designed to be a self-contained system of governance. However, it can also be integrated with other systems and frameworks, such as strategic planning or quality management systems.

**7. Fractal Properties:** The principles of the Policy Governance model can be applied at different scales, from a small non-profit to a large corporation. This fractal property of the model makes it a powerful tool for creating a culture of accountability and empowerment throughout the organization.

**Overall Score: 3 (Transitional)**

The Carver Policy Governance model is a transitional model with many features that align with the principles of a commons. However, its focus on a single group of "owners" and its lack of explicit attention to environmental and social sustainability are limitations. To become more fully aligned with the principles of a commons, the model could be enhanced by adopting a more comprehensive approach to stakeholder mapping, expanding the definition of value to include social and environmental value, explicitly addressing the issue of environmental sustainability, and providing a framework for distributing rights and responsibilities to a broader range of stakeholders.
