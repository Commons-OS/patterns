### 1. Overview (150-300 words)

Action Learning is a process that involves a small group of people working on real problems, taking action, and learning as individuals, as a team, and as an organization. It is a method of learning by doing, and it is based on the principle that people learn best when they are actively engaged in solving real-world problems. The core idea is that by reflecting on their actions, individuals and groups can learn from their experiences and improve their performance over time. This approach was pioneered by Reg Revans, who believed that traditional methods of teaching and learning were often ineffective in the workplace. He argued that people needed to be given the opportunity to learn from their own experiences and from the experiences of others. Revans developed Action Learning as a way to create a more dynamic and effective learning environment, where people could learn from their successes and failures and apply that learning to future challenges. The process is designed to be highly interactive and collaborative, with a focus on open-ended questioning and reflective dialogue. It is a powerful tool for individual and organizational development, and it has been used in a wide range of settings, from large corporations to small non-profit organizations.

### 2. Core Principles (3-7 principles, 200-400 words)

1. **Learning from Experience:** The cornerstone of Action Learning is the belief that people learn best when they are actively engaged in solving real-world problems. The process emphasizes the importance of learning from both successes and failures, and of applying that learning to future challenges.
2. **The Power of Questioning:** Action Learning is driven by a process of open-ended questioning and reflective dialogue. The goal is not to provide answers, but to help individuals and groups to explore their own assumptions, to see problems from different perspectives, and to develop their own solutions.
3. **The Social Nature of Learning:** Action Learning recognizes that learning is a social process. It emphasizes the importance of collaboration, of sharing experiences and perspectives, and of learning from and with others.
4. **The Importance of Reflection:** Action Learning is not just about doing, it is also about reflecting on what has been done. The process encourages individuals and groups to take the time to reflect on their experiences, to identify what they have learned, and to consider how they can apply that learning in the future.
5. **The Role of the Facilitator:** The role of the facilitator in Action Learning is not to teach, but to create a supportive and challenging learning environment. The facilitator helps to guide the process, to encourage participation, and to ensure that the group stays focused on its goals.

### 3. Key Practices (5-10 practices, 300-600 words)

1. **Forming the Action Learning Group:** A small group of 4-8 individuals is formed, ideally with diverse backgrounds and perspectives. This group, often called a "set," is the core of the Action Learning process.
2. **Presenting the Problem:** One member of the group presents a real-world problem or challenge that they are facing. This problem should be complex and have no easy solution.
3. **Clarifying Questions:** The other members of the group ask clarifying questions to better understand the problem and the context in which it is occurring. The focus is on understanding, not on providing solutions.
4. **Reframing the Problem:** Through the process of questioning and dialogue, the group helps the problem-presenter to reframe the problem, to see it from different perspectives, and to identify the underlying issues.
5. **Generating and Committing to Action:** The group brainstorms potential actions that the problem-presenter can take to address the problem. The problem-presenter then commits to taking a specific action before the next meeting.
6. **Taking Action:** The problem-presenter implements the chosen action in their workplace.
7. **Reflecting on the Action:** At the next meeting, the problem-presenter reports back to the group on the results of their action. The group then helps the problem-presenter to reflect on what they have learned from the experience.
8. **Repeating the Cycle:** The cycle of presenting a problem, asking clarifying questions, reframing the problem, generating and committing to action, taking action, and reflecting on the action is repeated. Over time, this iterative process leads to both individual and organizational learning.

### 4. Application Context (200-300 words)

Action Learning is a versatile methodology that can be applied in a wide range of contexts. It is particularly well-suited for developing leadership and management skills, solving complex problems that have no clear solution, fostering a culture of learning and continuous improvement, improving team performance and collaboration, and driving organizational change and innovation. However, it is not a panacea. It is not suitable for simple problems with clear solutions, or for situations where a quick fix is required. It is also unlikely to be successful in organizations with a culture that is resistant to change and learning.

Action Learning can be applied at all scales, from the individual to the ecosystem. It can be used to develop individual leaders, to improve the performance of teams, to drive change in departments and organizations, and to foster collaboration across multiple organizations and even entire ecosystems. Its versatility is also reflected in the wide range of domains in which it has been successfully applied, including business, government, education, healthcare, and non-profit organizations.

### 5. Implementation (400-600 words)

Successful implementation of Action Learning requires careful planning and execution. Before getting started, it is important to ensure that there are a few key prerequisites in place. First, there must be a clear and compelling business need that Action Learning can help to address. Second, there must be strong sponsorship from senior leadership, who can provide the necessary resources and support for the initiative. Third, the organization must have a culture that is open to learning and experimentation. Finally, the participants in the Action Learning set must be willing to be open, honest, and vulnerable with one another.

Once these prerequisites are in place, the next step is to get started. This typically involves securing sponsorship and resources, identifying a real and complex problem, forming the Action Learning set, training the set and the facilitator, and launching the set. It is important to note that Action Learning is not a one-time event, but an ongoing process of learning and development.

There are a number of common challenges that organizations may face when implementing Action Learning. These include a lack of time, a fear of failure, and difficult group dynamics. However, these challenges can be overcome with careful planning and a skilled facilitator.

There are also a number of success factors that can increase the likelihood of a successful Action Learning initiative. These include a real and urgent problem, a diverse and committed set, a skilled facilitator, a supportive organizational culture, and a commitment to action.

### 6. Evidence & Impact (300-500 words)

The impact of Action Learning is well-documented in both academic and practitioner literature. A number of high-profile organizations have successfully implemented Action Learning to drive strategic change, develop their leaders, and improve their business results. For example, Thomson Reuters used Action Learning to drive strategic alignment and cultural integration following its merger with Reuters. The program, which was developed in collaboration with two top business schools, helped to break down organizational boundaries and create a more collaborative, enterprise-wide mindset. Other notable adopters of Action Learning include National Australia Bank, PwC, Anglo American, and General Electric.

The documented outcomes of Action Learning are numerous and varied. They include improved leadership and management skills, enhanced problem-solving and decision-making capabilities, increased team performance and collaboration, greater organizational agility and adaptability, and a stronger culture of learning and continuous improvement.

The effectiveness of Action Learning is also supported by a growing body of research. A study by the World Institute for Action Learning (WIAL) found that Action Learning can lead to significant improvements in leadership skills, team performance, and organizational results. Research by Michael Marquardt and others has also shown that Action Learning is an effective methodology for developing leaders and for solving complex organizational problems. In addition, numerous case studies and articles have been published in academic and practitioner journals, providing further evidence of the effectiveness of Action Learning in a wide range of settings.

### 7. Cognitive Era Considerations (200-400 words)

The cognitive era presents both opportunities and challenges for Action Learning. On the one hand, AI and automation have the potential to significantly enhance the Action Learning process. For example, AI-powered tools can be used to analyze large amounts of data, to identify patterns and trends, and to provide real-time feedback to the Action Learning set. AI can also be used to create realistic simulations and to provide personalized learning experiences.

On the other hand, it is important to maintain a balance between human and machine. The core of Action Learning is the process of human interaction, of dialogue, and of reflection. These are all things that are uniquely human and that cannot be replaced by machines. The role of the facilitator will also remain critical in guiding the process and ensuring a psychologically safe environment for learning.

Looking to the future, we can expect to see a greater integration of AI and other technologies into the Action Learning process. This will enable organizations to create more powerful and effective learning experiences, and to accelerate the development of their leaders and teams. However, the fundamental principles of Action Learning, as developed by Reg Revans, will remain as relevant as ever.

### 8. Commons Alignment Assessment (600-800 words)

Action Learning has the potential to be a powerful tool for building the commons, but its alignment with the commons depends on how it is implemented. A commons-aligned approach to Action Learning would be one that is inclusive, holistic, and focused on creating value for all stakeholders, not just for the organization.

In terms of stakeholder mapping, Action Learning inherently encourages a multi-stakeholder perspective by bringing together individuals from different parts of an organization. However, a more commons-aligned approach would involve including external stakeholders, such as customers, suppliers, and community members, in the Action Learning process.

In terms of value creation, Action Learning creates value for individuals, teams, and the organization as a whole. However, a more commons-aligned approach would also consider the value created for the wider community and the environment.

In terms of value preservation, Action Learning helps to preserve value by building the capacity of the organization to learn and adapt to change. By fostering a culture of continuous improvement, it helps to ensure that the organization remains relevant and sustainable over the long term.

In terms of shared rights and responsibilities, the rights and responsibilities for learning are shared among all members in an Action Learning set. A more commons-aligned approach would extend these rights and responsibilities to a wider group of stakeholders.

In terms of systematic design, Action Learning is a systematic process that is designed to promote learning and problem-solving. The process is structured and facilitated, but it is also flexible and adaptable to the needs of the group.

In terms of systems of systems, Action Learning can be seen as a system of systems. Each Action Learning set is a system in itself, and these sets can be nested within larger systems, such as departments, divisions, and the organization as a whole. This fractal design allows for learning to occur at multiple levels of the organization.

Finally, in terms of fractal properties, the principles of Action Learning can be applied at all scales, from the individual to the ecosystem. The core ideas of learning from experience, of questioning and reflection, and of collaboration are all fractal in nature.

**Overall Score**: 3 - Transitional. While Action Learning has many of the characteristics of a commons-aligned pattern, it is often implemented in a way that is focused on the needs of the organization, rather than on the needs of the wider commons. To become more commons-aligned, organizations need to adopt a more inclusive and holistic approach to Action Learning, one that engages a wider range of stakeholders and that considers the social and environmental impact of their actions.

### 9. Resources & References (200-400 words)

There are a number of resources available for those who want to learn more about Action Learning. For essential reading, the works of Reg Revans, the pioneer of Action Learning, are a must-read. His book, *The origin and growth of action learning*, provides a comprehensive overview of the theory and practice of Action Learning. Other key texts include Michael Marquardt's *Optimizing the power of action learning* and Mike Pedler's edited volume, *Action learning in practice*.

There are also a number of organizations and communities that are dedicated to the promotion and practice of Action Learning. The World Institute for Action Learning (WIAL) is a global non-profit organization that offers a wealth of resources, including articles, case studies, and training programs. Action Learning Associates is a consulting firm that specializes in Action Learning and has worked with a wide range of organizations around the world.

In terms of tools and platforms, there are no specific tools that are required for Action Learning. However, a number of tools can be used to support the process, such as virtual meeting platforms, collaboration tools, and project management software.
