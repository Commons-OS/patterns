# TC030: Values Definition

### 1. Overview

The Values Definition pattern is the foundational process of identifying, articulating, and embedding a set of core principles that guide an organization's culture, behavior, and decision-making. These values are not mere marketing slogans; they are the deeply held beliefs that form the very DNA of the enterprise, shaping its identity and influencing every action it takes. The primary purpose of this pattern is to establish a clear and shared understanding of what the organization stands for, providing a moral and strategic compass for all stakeholders, from employees and leaders to partners and customers. By defining and operationalizing core values, a company can build a cohesive and purpose-driven culture, which is essential for long-term resilience and sustainable success. This process moves beyond generic statements to create a unique and authentic framework that reflects the organization's specific mission and vision.

The problem this pattern solves is the lack of a coherent and unifying identity that often plagues startups and established businesses alike. Without a clear set of values, organizations can suffer from inconsistent decision-making, a disengaged workforce, and a weak or confusing brand identity. This can lead to a host of issues, including low employee morale, high turnover, and a failure to connect with customers on a meaningful level. The Values Definition pattern addresses these challenges by providing a structured approach to discovering and articulating the principles that matter most to the organization. The concept of organizational values has been developed and popularized by numerous business leaders and thinkers over the years, with figures like Jim Collins and Jerry Porras in their book "Built to Last" emphasizing the importance of a core ideology. More recently, authors like Brené Brown have focused on the importance of operationalizing values to ensure they are more than just words on a wall.

In the context of commons-aligned value creation, the Values Definition pattern takes on a particularly significant role. Commons-aligned enterprises are, by their nature, purpose-driven and committed to creating value for a broader community of stakeholders, not just shareholders. A well-defined set of values is therefore critical for ensuring that the organization remains true to its mission of serving the common good. These values often include principles such as transparency, collaboration, and equitable distribution of resources, which are central to the commons philosophy. By explicitly defining and embedding these values, a commons-aligned organization can build a strong and resilient culture that is capable of navigating the complexities of balancing economic viability with social and ecological well-being. The Values Definition pattern, in this context, becomes a powerful tool for building trust and legitimacy with all stakeholders, fostering a sense of shared ownership and collective purpose.

### 2. Core Principles

1.  **Authenticity and Genuineness:** Core values must be an authentic reflection of the organization's true identity and the deeply held beliefs of its founders and key stakeholders. They cannot be aspirational statements that are disconnected from the reality of the organization's culture and practices. Authentic values are discovered, not invented, and they resonate with employees because they ring true.

2.  **Clarity and Specificity:** To be effective, values must be clearly articulated and specific enough to be actionable. Vague or generic values like "excellence" or "integrity" are meaningless without further definition and behavioral examples. The language used should be simple, direct, and easily understood by everyone in the organization.

3.  **Actionability and Integration:** Values are only meaningful if they are translated into concrete behaviors and integrated into all aspects of the organization's operations. This includes hiring, performance management, decision-making processes, and reward systems. Values must be lived, not just laminated.

4.  **Stakeholder Inclusivity:** The process of defining values should be inclusive, involving a broad range of stakeholders, including employees at all levels, leaders, and even customers and partners. This ensures that the values are representative of the entire organizational ecosystem and fosters a sense of shared ownership.

5.  **Endurance and Adaptability:** Core values should be enduring and timeless, providing a stable foundation for the organization as it grows and evolves. However, the *expression* of these values may need to adapt over time to remain relevant in a changing world. The core principles should remain constant, but the practices that flow from them can be flexible.

6.  **Purpose-Driven Foundation:** Values should be directly linked to the organization's overarching purpose and mission. They provide the "why" behind the "what" and "how" of the business, giving meaning and direction to the work being done. This connection to a higher purpose is a powerful motivator for employees and a key differentiator in the marketplace.

### 3. Key Practices

1.  **Conduct Foundational Leadership Workshops:** The process typically begins with the founding team or senior leadership. These workshops are designed to unearth the personal values of the leaders and explore how those values should shape the organization. Facilitated exercises, such as reflecting on peak experiences or moments of pride in the company's history, can help to surface the principles that are already implicitly guiding the organization.

2.  **Engage Employees Through Surveys and Focus Groups:** To ensure authenticity and buy-in, it is crucial to involve employees from all levels and departments. Anonymous surveys can be used to gather broad input on what employees believe the organization's values are and what they should be. Follow-up focus groups can then delve deeper into the survey findings, allowing for richer discussion and the collection of stories and examples that illustrate potential values in action.

3.  **Facilitate 'Values Jam' Sessions:** These are creative, high-energy brainstorming sessions where participants from across the organization come together to generate ideas about the company's values. These sessions can use a variety of techniques, such as mind mapping, storytelling, and affinity grouping, to encourage creative thinking and collaborative exploration of the organization's identity.

4.  **Synthesize and Refine Through Thematic Analysis:** The qualitative data gathered from workshops, surveys, and jam sessions must be systematically analyzed to identify recurring themes and patterns. This process involves coding the data and grouping similar concepts together to distill a long list of potential values down to a core set of 3-5 principles that are most essential and unique to the organization.

5.  **Define Observable Behaviors for Each Value:** For each core value, the team must articulate a set of specific, observable behaviors that exemplify the value in practice. For example, if a value is "Transparency," a corresponding behavior might be "We share information openly and proactively, even when it is difficult." This step is critical for making the values actionable and measurable.

6.  **Develop a Strategic Rollout and Communication Plan:** Once the values are finalized, they must be introduced to the organization in a thoughtful and engaging way. This is more than just an email announcement; it should be a multi-faceted campaign that might include all-hands meetings, team-based discussions, and the creation of physical and digital artifacts that celebrate the new values.

7.  **Embed Values into All People-Related Processes:** To ensure that the values are more than just words, they must be integrated into the fabric of the organization. This means incorporating them into the hiring process to attract and select values-aligned candidates, building them into performance review criteria, and creating recognition and reward programs that celebrate employees who exemplify the core values.

8.  **Cultivate a Culture of Storytelling and Continuous Reinforcement:** Values are kept alive through the stories that are told and retold within the organization. Leaders and employees should be encouraged to share examples of the values in action. Regular communication, both formal and informal, should reinforce the importance of the values and their connection to the organization's success.


### 4. Implementation

Implementing the Values Definition pattern is a deeply reflective and collaborative process that requires commitment from all levels of the organization. The first step is to assemble a dedicated cross-functional team to lead the initiative. This team should include representatives from leadership, HR, and various departments to ensure a diversity of perspectives. The process begins with a discovery phase, where the team gathers input from across the organization through a combination of surveys, interviews, and workshops. The goal of this phase is to unearth the authentic, living values that are already present in the organization's culture, as well as to identify aspirational values that will help the company achieve its future goals. A key consideration during this phase is to create a psychologically safe environment where employees feel comfortable sharing their honest opinions and experiences without fear of retribution.

Once a rich set of qualitative data has been collected, the next step is to synthesize this information to identify the core themes and patterns. This is often an iterative process of affinity mapping and thematic analysis, where the team clusters similar ideas and begins to draft a set of potential value statements. It is important to avoid generic or clichéd language and to strive for statements that are unique and specific to the organization. A real-world example of this is Zappos, whose values, such as "Deliver WOW Through Service" and "Create Fun and A Little Weirdness," are both memorable and deeply reflective of the company's unique culture. After drafting the values, it is crucial to define a set of observable behaviors for each one. This makes the values tangible and provides a clear guide for how they should be enacted in day-to-day work. For instance, a value of "Embrace and Drive Change" might be accompanied by behaviors like "We are not afraid to challenge the status quo" and "We are constantly looking for ways to innovate and improve."

The final step is to embed the newly defined values into the very fabric of the organization. This goes far beyond simply publishing them on the company website. It involves integrating the values into all people-related processes, from hiring and onboarding to performance management and promotions. For example, interview questions can be designed to assess a candidate's alignment with the company's values, and performance reviews can include a section on how well an employee has demonstrated the values in their work. It is also essential to create a communication and rollout plan that generates excitement and buy-in from all employees. This might include an all-hands launch event, storytelling campaigns that highlight the values in action, and ongoing reinforcement through internal communications and leadership messaging. The ultimate goal is to create a culture where the values are not just a poster on the wall, but a living, breathing part of the organization's identity.

### 5. 7 Pillars Assessment

| Pillar | Score (1-5) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | 5 | The Values Definition pattern is fundamentally about articulating and embedding the organization's purpose. It directly serves to clarify the "why" behind the organization's existence, making it highly aligned with this pillar. |
| Governance | 4 | Well-defined values provide a clear framework for decision-making, which is a key aspect of governance. When values are integrated into governance processes, they promote consistency and alignment with the organization's mission. |
| Culture | 5 | This pattern is a primary driver of organizational culture. The process of defining and embedding values is a powerful culture-building activity that shapes the shared norms, beliefs, and behaviors of the organization. |
| Incentives | 3 | While the Values Definition pattern provides the foundation for a values-aligned incentive system, it does not in itself create those incentives. The effectiveness of this pillar depends on the subsequent implementation of reward and recognition programs that are explicitly linked to the defined values. |
| Knowledge | 3 | The pattern can support knowledge sharing by fostering a culture of transparency and collaboration. However, its direct impact on knowledge management systems and practices is indirect. |
| Technology | 2 | The Values Definition pattern is primarily a human and cultural process. While technology can be used to support the process (e.g., surveys, communication platforms), it is not a core component of the pattern itself. |
| Resilience | 4 | A strong, values-based culture is a key source of organizational resilience. It provides a stable foundation that helps the organization to navigate uncertainty and adapt to change without losing its identity. |
| **Overall** | **4.0** | **The Values Definition pattern is a critical enabler of commons-aligned value creation, providing the cultural and strategic foundation for a purpose-driven enterprise. Its high scores in Purpose, Governance, and Culture reflect its central role in shaping the identity and direction of the organization. The overall score of 4.0 reflects its significant, but not all-encompassing, contribution to commons alignment.** |

### 6. When to Use

*   **Early-Stage Startups:** For new ventures, defining values from the outset is crucial for building a strong foundation for the company culture and ensuring that the founding team is aligned on the long-term vision.

*   **Periods of Rapid Growth or Scaling:** As a company grows, its culture can become diluted. The Values Definition pattern can help to reinforce the core identity of the organization and ensure that new hires are a good cultural fit.

*   **Mergers and Acquisitions:** When two companies come together, there is often a clash of cultures. A deliberate process of defining a new, shared set of values can help to unify the newly combined organization.

*   **Times of Crisis or Transformation:** When an organization is facing a significant challenge or undergoing a major change, revisiting and reaffirming its core values can provide a source of stability and guidance.

*   **Loss of Identity or Purpose:** If an organization feels that it has lost its way or that its culture has become toxic, the Values Definition pattern can be a powerful tool for rediscovery and renewal.

*   **Transition to a Commons-Aligned Model:** For organizations that are seeking to become more purpose-driven and community-oriented, the Values Definition pattern is an essential first step in aligning the organization's culture and practices with its new mission.

### 7. Anti-Patterns and Gotchas

*   **Top-Down Imposition:** Values that are created in a boardroom and imposed on the organization without any input from employees are likely to be met with cynicism and resistance. This "laminating the values" approach rarely leads to genuine cultural change.

*   **Aspirational Overreach:** While it is good to have aspirational values, they must be grounded in reality. If there is too large a gap between the stated values and the actual behavior of the organization, it can lead to a loss of credibility and employee disengagement.

*   **Lack of Behavioral Specificity:** Values that are not translated into specific, observable behaviors are difficult to act on and impossible to measure. This is often the case with generic values like "integrity" or "respect" that are not clearly defined.

*   **Failure to Integrate:** The most common failure in the Values Definition pattern is the failure to embed the values into the organization's systems and processes. If the values are not reflected in who gets hired, promoted, and rewarded, they will quickly become meaningless.

*   **Inconsistent Leadership Behavior:** The single fastest way to kill a values initiative is for leaders to say one thing and do another. Employees look to leaders to see what is truly valued in the organization, and any hypocrisy will be immediately apparent.

*   **One-and-Done Mentality:** Defining values is not a one-time event. It is an ongoing process of communication, reinforcement, and refinement. Organizations that treat it as a project to be completed and then forgotten will not see lasting results.
