# TC005: Founder Agreements

### 1. Overview

A Founder Agreement is a legal document created by the co-founders of a startup to outline their mutual rights, responsibilities, and obligations. Its core purpose is to establish a clear framework for the business relationship between the founders, covering crucial aspects such as equity ownership, roles and responsibilities, decision-making processes, and exit strategies. This proactive measure helps prevent future disputes and ensures that all founders are aligned on the company's direction from the outset. The problem it solves is the ambiguity and potential for conflict that can arise when a startup is launched without a formal agreement in place. As the company grows and faces new challenges, a well-drafted Founder Agreement serves as a foundational document that guides the founders' interactions and protects their individual and collective interests.

The concept of a Founder Agreement has been popularized by startup accelerators, venture capitalists, and legal experts who have witnessed the detrimental effects of founder disputes on promising ventures. Prominent figures in the startup world, such as Paul Graham of Y Combinator and Brad Feld of Foundry Group, have long advocated for the importance of these agreements. Their origin can be traced back to the early days of the tech industry, where the need for a formal understanding between co-founders became increasingly apparent as startups grew in complexity and value. In the context of commons-aligned value creation, a Founder Agreement can be a powerful tool for embedding shared values and principles into the very fabric of the organization. By explicitly defining the company's purpose, governance structure, and approach to knowledge sharing, the agreement can ensure that the startup remains committed to its commons-oriented mission as it evolves.

### 2. Core Principles

1.  **Clarity and Transparency:** The agreement should be written in clear, unambiguous language that is easily understood by all founders, regardless of their legal expertise. It should transparently outline all key terms and conditions, leaving no room for misinterpretation.
2.  **Fairness and Equity:** The distribution of equity and other rewards should be fair and equitable, reflecting each founder's contributions, both past and future. This includes considering factors such as initial investment, intellectual property, and ongoing commitment to the venture.
3.  **Mutual Accountability:** The agreement should establish a system of mutual accountability, where each founder is responsible for fulfilling their designated roles and responsibilities. This may include performance metrics, milestones, and consequences for failing to meet expectations.
4.  **Flexibility and Adaptability:** While the agreement should provide a solid framework, it should also be flexible enough to adapt to the changing needs of the startup. This may involve including provisions for amending the agreement as the company grows and evolves.
5.  **Conflict Resolution:** The agreement should include a clear process for resolving disputes between founders, such as mediation or arbitration. This helps prevent disagreements from escalating and jeopardizing the future of the company.
6.  **Long-Term Vision:** The agreement should reflect a shared long-term vision for the company, ensuring that all founders are aligned on its ultimate goals and direction.

### 3. Key Practices

1.  **Define Roles and Responsibilities:** Clearly outline the specific roles and responsibilities of each founder, including their titles and areas of authority. This helps avoid confusion and ensures that all key functions of the business are covered.
2.  **Determine Equity Ownership and Vesting:** Specify the percentage of equity each founder will receive and establish a vesting schedule to ensure that their ownership is earned over time. A typical vesting schedule is four years with a one-year cliff, meaning that founders must remain with the company for at least one year to receive any equity.
3.  **Establish Decision-Making Processes:** Define how key decisions will be made, including whether they require a unanimous vote, a majority vote, or are delegated to a specific founder. This should cover both major strategic decisions and day-to-day operational matters.
4.  **Include Intellectual Property Assignments:** Ensure that all intellectual property created by the founders related to the business is assigned to the company. This protects the company's most valuable assets and prevents founders from leaving with critical IP.
5.  **Outline Founder Compensation:** Specify the salaries, if any, that founders will receive and how they will be determined. This is particularly important if some founders are working full-time while others are part-time.
6.  **Plan for Founder Exits:** Include provisions for what happens if a founder leaves the company, whether voluntarily or involuntarily. This should cover the repurchase of their shares and the transition of their responsibilities.
7.  **Address Confidentiality and Non-Compete Clauses:** Include clauses that protect the company's confidential information and prevent founders from competing with the business after they leave.
8.  **Seek Legal Counsel:** It is highly recommended to have the Founder Agreement drafted or reviewed by an experienced startup lawyer to ensure that it is legally sound and protects the interests of all parties.

### 4. Implementation

Implementing a Founder Agreement begins with open and honest conversations between the co-founders. Before any legal document is drafted, it is crucial to discuss and agree upon the core principles and key practices that will govern the partnership. This includes having frank discussions about individual goals, expectations, and concerns. A step-by-step approach to implementation would involve: 1) a series of meetings to discuss and negotiate the key terms of the agreement; 2) the creation of a term sheet that summarizes the agreed-upon points; 3) the drafting of the formal Founder Agreement by a qualified legal professional; and 4) a final review and signing of the document by all co-founders. Key considerations during this process include ensuring that all founders have a clear understanding of the legal implications of the agreement and that the document accurately reflects their shared vision for the company.

Real-world examples of the importance of Founder Agreements abound in the startup world. The infamous legal battle between Mark Zuckerberg and the Winklevoss twins over the founding of Facebook serves as a cautionary tale of what can happen when these agreements are not in place. Conversely, many successful startups have attributed their longevity and stability to having a strong Founder Agreement from the very beginning. For instance, the founders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, had a clear understanding of their roles and equity split, which helped them navigate the company's rapid growth and success. By taking the time to create a comprehensive Founder Agreement, startups can lay a solid foundation for a healthy and productive partnership, increasing their chances of long-term success.

### 5. 7 Pillars Assessment

| Pillar | Score (1-5) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | 4 | A Founder Agreement can be a powerful tool for codifying a startup's commons-aligned purpose, but it is not a substitute for a genuine commitment to that purpose. |
| Governance | 5 | The agreement is a cornerstone of good governance, establishing clear rules for decision-making, accountability, and conflict resolution. |
| Culture | 3 | While the agreement can influence the company's culture, it is the day-to-day actions of the founders that truly shape the cultural environment. |
| Incentives | 4 | The agreement can align incentives by linking equity and other rewards to the achievement of commons-oriented goals, but it can also create perverse incentives if not carefully designed. |
| Knowledge | 4 | By including provisions for knowledge sharing and open-source licensing, the agreement can promote the creation of a knowledge commons. |
| Technology | 3 | The agreement is largely agnostic to the specific technologies used by the startup, but it can encourage the use of open and interoperable technologies. |
| Resilience | 5 | A well-drafted Founder Agreement is a critical component of a startup's resilience, providing a stable framework for navigating challenges and disputes. |
| **Overall** | **4.0** | **A Founder Agreement is an essential tool for any startup, and it can be particularly valuable for those committed to commons-aligned value creation. By providing a clear and transparent framework for the founders' relationship, the agreement can help ensure that the company remains true to its mission as it grows and evolves.** |

### 6. When to Use

*   When starting a new venture with one or more co-founders.
*   Before making any significant investments of time or money in the business.
*   When there is a need to clarify the roles, responsibilities, and expectations of each founder.
*   When seeking investment from venture capitalists or other external investors.
*   When the business involves valuable intellectual property that needs to be protected.
*   When there is a desire to create a strong foundation for a long-term, sustainable business.

### 7. Anti-Patterns and Gotchas

*   **Procrastination:** Delaying the creation of a Founder Agreement until a conflict arises, at which point it is often too late to resolve the issue amicably.
*   **Using a generic template without customization:** Failing to tailor the agreement to the specific needs and circumstances of the startup.
*   **Not seeking legal advice:** Attempting to draft the agreement without the assistance of a qualified lawyer, which can result in a legally unenforceable document.
*   **Unequal equity splits without justification:** Distributing equity in a way that is not perceived as fair by all founders, which can lead to resentment and conflict.
*   **Failing to include a vesting schedule:** Allowing founders to retain their full equity stake even if they leave the company prematurely.
*   **Ignoring the importance of cultural fit:** Focusing solely on the legal and financial aspects of the agreement while neglecting the importance of a shared vision and values.
