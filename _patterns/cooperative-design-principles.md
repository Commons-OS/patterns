# 1. Overview

Cooperative Design Principles represent a paradigm shift in the design process, moving from a designer-centric model to a collaborative and democratic approach that actively involves all stakeholders. This methodology is rooted in the belief that the people who will ultimately use a product, service, or system are best equipped to inform its design. By integrating users and other stakeholders into the creative process, Cooperative Design aims to produce solutions that are not only more effective and user-friendly but also more equitable and empowering. The principles of cooperative design are not a rigid set of rules but rather a flexible framework that can be adapted to a wide range of contexts, from software development and urban planning to organizational design and social innovation. At its core, Cooperative Design is about fostering a culture of mutual learning, shared ownership, and collective creativity, where the traditional boundaries between designers and users are blurred, and everyone has a voice in shaping the final outcome.

# 2. Core Principles

The principles of Cooperative Design are derived from the broader cooperative movement and have been adapted to the specific context of the design process. These principles provide a framework for creating a more democratic, equitable, and effective design process. The following are the core principles of Cooperative Design, based on the seven cooperative principles of the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) [1] and the principles of participatory design outlined by the Interaction Design Foundation (IxDF) [2].

**1. Voluntary and Open Membership:** This principle, adapted from the ICA, emphasizes that participation in the design process should be open to all stakeholders who are willing and able to contribute, without any form of discrimination. In the context of design, this means actively seeking out and including a diverse range of voices, including end-users, community members, subject matter experts, and other relevant parties. This inclusivity ensures that the design process is enriched by a wide range of perspectives and experiences, leading to more robust and relevant outcomes.

**2. Democratic Member Control:** This principle, also from the ICA, states that cooperatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members. In Cooperative Design, this translates to a design process where all participants have a voice in decision-making. This doesn't necessarily mean that every decision is made by consensus, but it does mean that there are clear and transparent processes for making decisions, and that all participants have the opportunity to contribute to and influence those decisions. This principle of democratic control helps to ensure that the final design reflects the collective wisdom of the group, rather than the preferences of a single designer or a small group of experts.

**3. Member Economic Participation:** While the original ICA principle focuses on the economic participation of members in a cooperative, in the context of Cooperative Design, this principle can be interpreted more broadly to mean that all participants should have a stake in the outcome of the design process. This could take many forms, from co-ownership of the final product to a share in the benefits that it generates. The key idea is that all participants should feel a sense of ownership and investment in the project, which can lead to greater commitment and a higher quality outcome.

**4. Autonomy and Independence:** This principle emphasizes the importance of self-organization and self-governance in the design process. Cooperative Design projects should be autonomous and independent, free from the undue influence of external parties. This allows the design team to stay true to its values and goals, and to make decisions that are in the best interests of the project and its stakeholders. This principle also encourages a spirit of self-reliance and resourcefulness, as the design team takes responsibility for its own success.

**5. Education, Training, and Information:** This principle highlights the importance of continuous learning and knowledge sharing in the design process. Cooperative Design is a process of mutual learning, where designers and users learn from each other. Designers learn about the needs and experiences of users, while users learn about the design process and the possibilities of technology. This principle also emphasizes the importance of providing participants with the information and training they need to participate effectively in the design process.

**6. Cooperation Among Cooperatives:** This principle encourages collaboration and mutual support among different Cooperative Design projects. By sharing knowledge, resources, and best practices, Cooperative Design projects can learn from each other and collectively advance the field. This principle also encourages a spirit of solidarity and mutual aid, as different projects support each other in their efforts to create a more just and equitable world.

**7. Concern for Community:** This principle, which is central to the cooperative movement, emphasizes that cooperatives should work for the sustainable development of their communities. In the context of Cooperative Design, this means that the design process should be guided by a concern for the well-being of the community as a whole. This includes considering the social, economic, and environmental impacts of the design, and striving to create solutions that are not only user-friendly but also socially and environmentally responsible.

# 3. Key Practices

Cooperative Design is not just a set of principles, but also a collection of practices and techniques for putting those principles into action. These practices are designed to facilitate collaboration, communication, and co-creation among all participants in the design process. The following are some of the key practices of Cooperative Design, drawn from the literature on participatory and co-design [2, 3].

*   **Design Workshops:** Design workshops are a cornerstone of Cooperative Design. These are structured events that bring together a diverse group of stakeholders to work together on a specific design challenge. Workshops can be used for a variety of purposes, from brainstorming and ideation to prototyping and testing. They provide a space for participants to share their knowledge and perspectives, and to work together to create a shared vision for the project.

*   **Prototyping:** Prototyping is a key practice for making ideas tangible and testable. In Cooperative Design, prototypes are not just created by designers, but are co-created with users and other stakeholders. This can involve a variety of techniques, from low-fidelity paper prototypes to high-fidelity interactive mockups. The goal of prototyping is to create a shared understanding of the design, and to get feedback from users early and often in the design process.

*   **Storytelling:** Storytelling is a powerful tool for understanding the needs and experiences of users. In Cooperative Design, participants are encouraged to share their stories and experiences related to the design challenge. These stories can help to build empathy and understanding among the design team, and to inspire new design ideas. Storytelling can also be used to create a shared narrative for the project, which can help to build a sense of community and shared purpose.

*   **Cultural Probes:** Cultural probes are a technique for gathering inspiration and insights from users in their own environment. Probes are typically a collection of items, such as a camera, a diary, and a set of postcards, that are given to users to document their lives and experiences. The probes are designed to be open-ended and playful, and to encourage users to reflect on their lives in new and creative ways. The materials that users create with the probes can then be used as a source of inspiration for the design team.

*   **Future Workshops:** Future workshops are a technique for collectively imagining and designing a better future. These workshops typically involve three phases: a critique phase, where participants identify the problems with the current situation; a fantasy phase, where participants imagine their ideal future; and an implementation phase, where participants develop a plan for how to get from the present to the future. Future workshops are a powerful tool for empowering participants to take control of their own future, and to create a shared vision for a better world.

# 4. Application Context

Cooperative Design Principles can be applied in a wide variety of contexts, from the design of new technologies to the reorganization of public services. The principles are particularly well-suited to complex problems that require the input and collaboration of a diverse group of stakeholders. The following table provides some examples of how Cooperative Design Principles can be applied in different domains.

| Domain | Application | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Software Development** | Involving users in the design of new software applications | A software company hosts a series of workshops with its users to co-design a new feature for its product. |
| **Urban Planning** | Engaging residents in the design of their own neighborhoods | A city government works with residents to co-design a new park in their community. |
| **Healthcare** | Involving patients and their families in the design of new healthcare services | A hospital works with patients and their families to co-design a new system for managing appointments. |
| **Education** | Engaging students and teachers in the design of new learning experiences | A school works with students and teachers to co-design a new curriculum. |
| **Organizational Design** | Involving employees in the design of their own work processes | A company works with its employees to co-design a new system for managing projects. |

These are just a few examples of the many ways that Cooperative Design Principles can be applied. The principles are not a one-size-fits-all solution, but rather a flexible framework that can be adapted to the specific needs of each project. The key is to create a design process that is inclusive, democratic, and empowering for all participants.

# 5. Implementation

Implementing Cooperative Design Principles requires a shift in mindset from the traditional, top-down approach to design. It requires a willingness to share power and control with users and other stakeholders, and to embrace a more emergent and iterative design process. The following are some key steps for implementing Cooperative Design Principles in a project.

1.  **Identify and Engage Stakeholders:** The first step is to identify all of the stakeholders who have an interest in the project. This includes not only end-users, but also community members, subject matter experts, and anyone else who will be affected by the design. Once the stakeholders have been identified, they need to be engaged in the design process in a meaningful way. This could involve a variety of techniques, from interviews and surveys to workshops and co-design sessions.

2.  **Establish a Collaborative Environment:** The next step is to create a collaborative environment where all participants feel comfortable sharing their ideas and perspectives. This means creating a space where everyone's voice is heard and respected, and where there is a sense of shared ownership and purpose. It also means providing participants with the tools and resources they need to collaborate effectively, such as whiteboards, sticky notes, and prototyping materials.

3.  **Co-create a Shared Vision:** Once a collaborative environment has been established, the next step is to co-create a shared vision for the project. This involves working together to define the problem, identify the goals, and develop a shared understanding of what success will look like. This shared vision will serve as a guide for the rest of the design process, and will help to ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals.

4.  **Iterate and Refine:** Cooperative Design is an iterative process, which means that the design is constantly evolving based on feedback from users and other stakeholders. This requires a willingness to experiment, to make mistakes, and to learn from those mistakes. The design team should be constantly seeking feedback on the design, and should be willing to make changes based on that feedback. This iterative process helps to ensure that the final design is as good as it can be.

5.  **Empower Participants to Take Ownership:** The final step is to empower participants to take ownership of the design. This means giving them the tools and resources they need to continue to develop and evolve the design over time. It also means creating a governance structure that allows participants to continue to have a say in the future of the project. By empowering participants to take ownership of the design, you can help to ensure that it will continue to meet their needs long after the initial design process is over.

# 6. Evidence & Impact

The impact of Cooperative Design can be seen in a wide range of projects and initiatives around the world. From the design of new technologies to the reorganization of public services, Cooperative Design has been shown to lead to more effective, equitable, and sustainable outcomes. The following are some examples of the evidence and impact of Cooperative Design.

One of the most well-known examples of the impact of Cooperative Design is the **TransMilenio bus system in Bogotá, Colombia**. In the early 2000s, the city of Bogotá embarked on a participatory design process to create a new public transportation system. The project involved a series of community meetings, workshops, and design charrettes, where residents were able to provide input and feedback on the design of the new system. The result was a bus system that was designed to meet the specific needs of the city's residents, with features such as dedicated bus lanes, stations with high platforms for easy boarding, and pre-paid tickets to speed up boarding times. The TransMilenio system has been a huge success, and has been credited with reducing travel times, improving safety, and increasing residents' access to jobs and services [2].

Another example of the impact of Cooperative Design can be seen in the **Scandinavian workplace democracy movement** of the 1960s and 1970s. During this time, a number of research projects were initiated to explore how workers could be more involved in the design of their own work and workplaces. These projects, which were rooted in the principles of action research and sociotechnical design, led to the development of a number of new techniques for involving workers in the design process, such as the use of mockups, prototypes, and design games. The Scandinavian workplace democracy movement had a profound impact on the field of design, and helped to lay the groundwork for the development of participatory design as a distinct field of practice [4].

More recently, Cooperative Design principles have been applied in the field of **healthcare**, with a growing number of projects involving patients and their families in the design of new healthcare services. For example, a study by Bate and Robert (2006) describes a project in the UK where patients were involved in the co-design of a new cancer care service. The project resulted in a number of improvements to the service, including better communication between patients and staff, and a more holistic approach to care [5].

These are just a few examples of the many ways that Cooperative Design has been shown to have a positive impact on the world. By involving users and other stakeholders in the design process, Cooperative Design can help to create solutions that are more effective, equitable, and sustainable.

# 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

The Cognitive Era, characterized by the rise of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other cognitive technologies, presents both new opportunities and new challenges for Cooperative Design. On the one hand, these technologies have the potential to enhance and augment the cooperative design process in a number of ways. For example, AI-powered tools could be used to analyze large datasets of user feedback, to generate new design ideas, or to create more realistic and immersive prototypes. On the other hand, the increasing complexity and opacity of these technologies also raises new questions about how to ensure that they are designed and used in a way that is consistent with the principles of Cooperative Design.

One of the key challenges of the Cognitive Era is the so-called "black box" problem, which refers to the fact that it can be difficult to understand how and why AI systems make the decisions they do. This lack of transparency can make it difficult to involve users and other stakeholders in the design of these systems, as they may not have the technical expertise to understand how they work. It can also make it difficult to hold these systems accountable for their decisions, which can have serious ethical implications.

Another challenge of the Cognitive Era is the potential for these technologies to be used to manipulate and control people. For example, AI-powered systems could be used to create personalized and persuasive messages that are designed to influence people's behavior. This raises new questions about how to ensure that these technologies are used in a way that is respectful of people's autonomy and independence.

Despite these challenges, the Cognitive Era also presents a number of opportunities for Cooperative Design. For example, AI-powered tools could be used to create more inclusive and accessible design processes. For example, natural language processing tools could be used to translate between different languages, or to create summaries of long and complex documents. This could help to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to participate in the design process, regardless of their language or literacy skills.

Ultimately, the key to navigating the challenges and opportunities of the Cognitive Era is to stay true to the core principles of Cooperative Design. This means creating design processes that are inclusive, democratic, and empowering for all participants. It also means being mindful of the ethical implications of these new technologies, and working to ensure that they are used in a way that is beneficial to society as a whole.

### 8. Commons Alignment Assessment (v2.0)

This assessment evaluates the pattern based on the Commons OS v2.0 framework, which focuses on the pattern's ability to enable resilient collective value creation.

**1. Stakeholder Architecture:**
The pattern establishes a robust stakeholder architecture by emphasizing "Voluntary and Open Membership" and "Democratic Member Control." It explicitly grants stakeholders the right to participate and influence decisions, fostering a collaborative environment where rights and responsibilities are shared among all participants, including users, designers, and the wider community.

**2. Value Creation Capability:**
Cooperative Design directly enables the creation of diverse forms of value beyond the purely economic. Through its principle of "Concern for Community" and practices like co-creation workshops, it generates social value (equitable solutions), knowledge value (mutual learning), and ecological value by considering the broader impacts of the design on the community and environment.

**3. Resilience & Adaptability:**
The pattern is inherently designed for resilience and adaptability through its iterative and feedback-driven process. The practice of continuous prototyping and refinement with users allows the resulting systems to evolve and adapt to changing contexts and user needs, ensuring they remain coherent and functional under stress.

**4. Ownership Architecture:**
Ownership is framed as shared rights and responsibilities rather than just monetary equity. The principle of "Member Economic Participation" is interpreted as all participants having a stake in the outcome, fostering a sense of collective ownership and investment in the project's success and long-term value.

**5. Design for Autonomy:**
With its emphasis on "Autonomy and Independence," the pattern is highly compatible with autonomous systems. The principles of self-organization and democratic control are foundational for DAOs and other distributed systems, providing a governance framework that can operate with low coordination overhead once shared understanding is established.

**6. Composability & Interoperability:**
The pattern is highly composable, as stated in the "Cooperation Among Cooperatives" principle, which encourages sharing knowledge and best practices. It is a flexible framework, not a rigid process, designed to be combined with other patterns and methodologies to construct larger, more complex value-creation ecosystems.

**7. Fractal Value Creation:**
The value-creation logic of Cooperative Design is fractal, applying effectively at multiple scales. The pattern has been successfully used for everything from small software features to large-scale urban planning projects like Bogotá's TransMilenio bus system, demonstrating its ability to scale its collaborative principles across different levels of complexity.

**Overall Score: 5 (Value Creation Architecture)**

**Rationale:**
Cooperative Design Principles provide a comprehensive and foundational architecture for resilient collective value creation. The pattern systematically addresses all seven pillars of the Commons OS v2.0 framework, offering a complete model for defining stakeholder relationships, fostering diverse value creation, and ensuring adaptability and scalability. It moves beyond simple participation to create a truly democratic and empowering design process.

**Opportunities for Improvement:**
- Explicitly integrate considerations for non-human stakeholders, such as the environment or AI agents, into the stakeholder architecture.
- Develop clearer guidelines for applying the principles in fully asynchronous or globally distributed digital environments.
- Create more defined mechanisms for capturing and distributing the non-economic value (e.g., knowledge, reputation) generated during the process.
