Identity is not discovered but continually constructed through choices, relationships, and narrative.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Identity development.

---

### Section 1: Context

In most organizational and movement ecosystems, identity gets treated as a fixed trait to be diagnosed, sorted, and managed. People are hired for their "type," assigned roles that match predetermined profiles, and expected to perform consistent versions of themselves across contexts. Intrapreneurs—people stewarding value creation within larger systems—face particular pressure: they must prove stable enough to be trusted with resources, yet fluid enough to navigate shifting conditions. The commons that support intrapreneurship are fragmenting precisely because they enforce static identities. A developer stays "the architect." An organizer stays "the fundraiser." A product manager stays "the strategist." What emerges is a system where people calcify into roles, where growth feels like betrayal, and where the most vital parts of a person—the becoming, the experimentation, the narrative revision—get treated as instability. This pattern arises in organizations recognizing that their intrapreneurs' capacity to generate value depends on continuous identity construction, not identity preservation. It shows up in movements where rigid role assignments kill adaptive capacity. It surfaces in products designed around user personas that suffocate actual user evolution.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Stability vs. Growth.**

Organizations need to know who people are—for coordination, accountability, resource allocation. Growth, by definition, means people are becoming *different* than they were. The tension breaks at three fracture points: **Role ossification**, where people internalize their job titles as identities and resist the learning that would stretch them. **Permission denial**, where "that's not who you are" (or "that's not what this organization is") becomes the blocking force to genuine becoming. **Narrative mismatch**, where the story people tell about themselves, the story the system tells about them, and the story they're living diverge—and nobody notices until trust collapses.

Unresolved, this tension produces a commons that runs on fumes. Intrapreneurs plateau. Movements calcify into ideological tribes where people play versions of themselves rather than growing into themselves. Corporate cultures develop antibodies against the very people who could adapt them. The keywords here are crucial: "fixed essence" suggests people are knowable once and for all. But people are ongoing. They construct identity through *choices* (what they decide to do), *relationships* (what mirrors reflect back to them), and *narrative* (the stories they tell about what they've done and what comes next). If your commons assumes identity is fixed, it cannot hold people who are becoming.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, design commons spaces where identity construction is visible, supported, and collectively stewarded—where people can narrate their own becoming and receive institutional recognition for growth, not just stability.**

The mechanism is narrative recognition. Most organizations recognize *outputs* (delivered code, closed deals, organized events). This pattern shifts recognition toward *narrative moves*—moments when someone reauthors their identity in relation to the commons. When a subject matter expert says "I want to learn to organize" and is given conditions to do so, when a backend engineer experiments with user research and is asked to present what they're discovering, when an organizer moves from service to strategy and the movement creates space for them to tell this story—these are not distractions from "real work." They are the work that generates new capacity.

Identity construction in commons contexts works like a living mycelium. Each person is a node. Each relationship, each project, each decision to try something new creates a thread. The commons is not the person; it is the network that makes growth visible and rooted. When someone experiments with a new skill inside the commons, they are not leaving their identity behind. They are extending it. The commons works when it:

**Creates narrative containers** where people can publicly articulate who they are becoming, not just who they are. A research sprint is not just a technical output; it is a moment for someone to say "I am becoming the kind of person who understands user behavior." The commons then witnesses and records this narrative move, giving it institutional weight.

**Multiplies mirrors**. Identity is constructed through reflection. The commons works when people receive feedback not just on their work but on their becoming—"I notice you're building capacity in systems thinking" or "Your way of holding complexity has shifted." These are identity observations, not performance reviews.

**Iterates permission structures**. Who gets to try what? Most systems draw these boundaries once (your role, your domain, your expertise). This pattern treats permission as an ongoing negotiation. "What are you learning to do? What conditions would let you do it here? What would you need to report back?" This keeps identity construction from being private fantasy and grounds it in collective reality.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**In corporate contexts**, establish "Identity Construction Reflection Cycles"—quarterly conversations distinct from performance reviews. Ask: "Who were you as a practitioner at the start of this quarter? Who are you becoming? What choices or relationships shifted your narrative?" Document these narratives in a visible commons space (not a personnel file—a shared repository). Create "Cross-functional Apprenticeships" where people rotate 20% of their time into unfamiliar domains *and* present monthly what they're discovering about themselves as thinkers and makers. When someone moves between technical and product work, don't erase their former identity; have them narrate the bridge they're building.

**In government and public service contexts**, recognize that civic identity is constructed through service narratives. Create "Role Evolution Sessions" at team level where people articulate the evolution of their understanding of their own position. A case worker who is becoming more systems-oriented should narrate that becoming to their peers and to their supervisor. Build it into governance structures: when someone moves into a leadership role, have them tell the story of how they've constructed that readiness. Document these narratives as part of institutional memory, not as individual dossiers. This prevents the common collapse where people are promoted but the organization never integrates the wisdom of their transformation.

**In activist and movement contexts**, the work is explicit identity construction. Establish "Becoming Circles"—regular gatherings where people say who they are building capacity to be. These are not therapy; they are political. They are how movements regenerate rather than burn out. An organizer becoming a trainer is making a collective statement. A volunteer becoming a strategist is a narrative move that strengthens the movement if witnessed and honored. Create exit conversations where people leaving the movement narrate what they've become through participation, and those staying narrate what they're moving toward. This prevents the hemorrhaging that happens when people's growth is invisible or treated as betrayal.

**In tech and product contexts**, embed identity construction into design. User personas are dead. Replace them with "User Becoming Narratives"—documented stories of how your actual users construct identity through your product. What choices does your product enable them to narrate? What relationships does it facilitate? When you redesign, ask: "Does this support the identity construction we're seeing, or does it enforce a fixed model?" On your team, create "Skill Becoming Transparency"—visible records (Slack channels, wiki pages, design docs) where people narrate learning edges, not just expertise. A designer learning to think about systems should present that thinking in progress. An engineer beginning to care about accessibility should narrate that shift to the team. This prevents the siloing that happens when people's growth is private.

**Cross all contexts**: Establish a simple ritual—a "Narrative Checkpoint" every quarter. In a meeting, each person (or each team) tells a 3-minute story: "I was X. I became Y. Here's what moved me." No PowerPoint. No metrics. Just narrative. Record these. Over time, you're building a commons document of how people construct identity together. You're also making the invisible visible: growth becomes institutional fact, not private hope.

---

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes**: When identity construction is visible and supported, adaptive capacity emerges. People take on unfamiliar problems not because their role requires it but because they're curious who they can become. Intrapreneurs stop burning out because they're continuously renewing their sense of themselves through growth, not just through output. Collaboration deepens because people are no longer protecting fixed versions of themselves; they're sharing edges and uncertainties. Trust increases in counterintuitive ways—not because everyone is "consistent," but because people are transparent about their becoming. Movements develop staying power because people can grow into deeper roles rather than cycling out when they've exhausted their first identity.

**What risks emerge**: The pattern is only as good as the commons holding it. Without clear boundaries, identity construction can become narcissistic performance—people using the commons as a stage for ego rather than as a container for genuine becoming. There is also risk of *compulsory narrative*, where people feel pressure to constantly demonstrate growth or face the implicit message that they're stagnant. Because resilience scores low (3.0), watch particularly for this: the pattern can feel vigorous while fragility increases underneath. If the commons doesn't actively root identity construction in collective purpose, it becomes individualistic drift. Someone keeps narrating becoming without asking *why* this becoming matters to the system. The pattern can also enable *shirking*—people perpetually "learning" rather than delivering. Implementation must be tight: identity construction must be tethered to actual value creation, not separate from it.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Pixar and the "Technical Fellowship"**: At Pixar, senior technologists could pursue identity construction without leaving the organization. A software architect didn't have to become a manager to grow. Instead, Pixar created "Technical Fellow" roles where people narrated new directions—one fellow moved into research, another into education, another into cross-studio innovation. Each narrated their becoming publicly. The organization watched and learned. The fellow found permission and mirrors. This sustained vitality precisely because it treated identity as ongoing construction, not fixed rank.

**The Movement for Black Lives and "Organizer Becoming"**: During the 2015–2020 period, MBL chapters created "Organizer Development" spaces distinct from operational meetings. In these spaces, people narrated their evolution from action-taker to strategist, from local to network thinker, from volume-focused to power-analysis-focused. They weren't promoted; they were recognized as constructing new identities in service of the movement. Those who left—some to electoral work, some to arts organizing—narrated their becoming and left that narrative with the movement. This prevented the common collapse where people disappear and take their learning with them.

**Basecamp and "Vertical Slicing"**: Basecamp's work structure (small, cross-functional teams) requires continuous identity construction. A designer is not only "the designer" but becomes "the strategist" or "the researcher" depending on project. Basecamp makes this visible through monthly "On Rotation" pieces where people narrate which part of themselves they're exploring that cycle. Over years, this creates a commons where people know each other's becomings, not just their roles. It's also their insurance policy: when economic contraction hits, the commons has documented who people have become together. Identity is not fragile.

---

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age of AI and networked abundance, this pattern becomes more critical and more fragile. AI makes identity seem more fixed than ever—you are the sum of your training data, your skill set, your demonstrated capability. Hiring algorithms, recommendation engines, and reputation systems all push toward identity calcification. Yet this is precisely when humans need to be actively constructing identity—staying ahead of automation, moving into spaces where adaptive judgment matters.

The tech context translation reveals the leverage: if your product is built on fixed user personas (assumptions about who people "are"), you'll miss the users you're creating. Netflix's strength is not its prediction engine; it is that users feel they can construct identity *through* watching, and the algorithm witnesses that becoming. But TikTok's darker edge is that the algorithm sometimes optimizes for keeping people locked into identity constructs ("you are a fitness person," "you are a conspiracy theorist") rather than enabling construction.

The risk in the cognitive era is that commons infrastructure itself gets automated. If your identity recognition system is algorithmic (an AI that "notices" growth patterns), you've outsourced the most essential part: the mirroring that is fundamentally relational. An algorithm cannot witness your becoming; it can only classify it. The pattern requires human narrative work—people telling stories to people, people receiving stories as recognition. In a world of abundance, this is increasingly rare and precious, and it is increasingly what separates systems that adapt from systems that ossify.

The new leverage: organizations and movements that explicitly protect narrative work—the time and space for people to tell stories about becoming—will attract and retain the generative capacity that no AI can replicate.

---

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life**: People spontaneously narrate their becoming to each other—in meetings, in informal settings, without prompting. There is curiosity about who each other is *becoming*, not just judgment of who they are. You overhear conversations like "I'm learning to think about this differently" or "I didn't know you were going in that direction." Second: visible movement across the commons—people taking on unfamiliar work, leading in new domains, teaching what they've learned—and this movement is celebrated as institutional maturity, not as instability. Third: when people leave, the organization can articulate what they became during their time. There is a legacy narrative, not just a role transition. Fourth: newcomers are asked "Who are you becoming?" not just "Who are you?" This signals that the commons is built for growth.

**Signs of decay**: Identity becomes fixed in conversation. You hear "That's just how X is" more often than "X is learning to..." People protect their roles—"that's not my job" hardens into defensiveness rather than clarification. The commons stops witnessing becoming; it only counts delivery. Narrative becomes performance—quarterly "accomplishment" reviews with no real becoming recorded. You see people burning out not from overwork but from being trapped in outdated versions of themselves. The commons forgets its own becoming stories; there is no institutional memory of transformation. Most damning: when someone brings a new identity—"I want to learn X"—the system's first response is "We don't need that" rather than "Let's see what that could become for us."

**When to replant**: This pattern needs replanting when the commons has grown too large to hold narrative work in its current form (typically at 50+ people), or when rapid external change requires the commons to collectively construct a new identity (a movement entering a new phase, an organization shifting strategy). The right moment is when you notice the system is asking "Who are we?" because that's when identity construction becomes collective. Restart this practice explicitly: gather people, ask "Who are we becoming together?" and listen for the narrative that emerges. That becomes your seed.
