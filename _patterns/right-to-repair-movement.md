# Right to Repair Movement

## 1. Overview

The Right to Repair movement is a global effort advocating for the right of consumers and independent repair shops to repair and modify products they own. [1] This movement challenges the practice of manufacturers creating a closed-loop system where they control the repair and maintenance of their products, often to the detriment of the consumer. Proponents of the Right to Repair argue that if you own a product, you should have the right to fix it yourself or take it to a technician of your choice. [2] The movement has gained significant momentum in recent years, with a growing number of consumers, consumer rights organizations, and even governments pushing for legislation to protect these rights. [3]

The central issue at the heart of the Right to Repair movement is the increasing difficulty of repairing modern products, particularly electronics. Manufacturers often use a variety of tactics to make repairs difficult or impossible, such as using proprietary parts, requiring specialized tools, and implementing software locks that prevent unauthorized repairs. [4] These practices, often referred to as a “repair monopoly,” force consumers to rely on the manufacturer for repairs, which can be expensive and inconvenient. [5] The movement argues that these restrictions not only harm consumers but also have a significant negative impact on the environment, contributing to a growing mountain of e-waste. [6]

The Right to Repair movement has its roots in the automotive industry, where car manufacturers have long been required to provide independent repair shops with access to the same diagnostic and repair information as their authorized dealers. [7] However, the movement has since expanded to encompass a wide range of products, including smartphones, laptops, agricultural equipment, and even medical devices. [8] The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of the Right to Repair, as hospitals struggled to repair critical medical equipment due to manufacturer restrictions. [9]

The movement has achieved several significant victories in recent years, with a number of countries and states passing Right to Repair legislation. [10] These laws typically require manufacturers to make parts, tools, and repair information available to consumers and independent repair shops at a reasonable price. While the specifics of the legislation vary, the overarching goal is to create a more open and competitive market for repairs, giving consumers more choice and control over the products they own. [11]

## 2. Core Principles

The Right to Repair movement is founded on a set of core principles that emphasize consumer rights, sustainability, and open access to information. These principles serve as the foundation for the movement's advocacy efforts and legislative proposals. The following are the key principles that define the Right to Repair movement:

**1. Ownership Means You Own It All:** The most fundamental principle of the Right to Repair movement is that if you buy a product, you own it outright. This means you should have the right to do what you want with it, including repairing it, modifying it, or even taking it apart to see how it works. [12] This principle challenges the notion that manufacturers can retain control over a product even after it has been sold.

**2. Information Should be Accessible:** The Right to Repair movement advocates for open access to repair information, including repair manuals, schematics, and diagnostic tools. [13] Proponents argue that this information is essential for consumers and independent repair shops to be able to diagnose and repair products effectively. Without access to this information, repairs can be difficult or impossible, forcing consumers to rely on the manufacturer for even the simplest of repairs.

**3. Parts and Tools Should be Available:** The movement also calls for manufacturers to make spare parts and specialized tools available to consumers and independent repair shops at a reasonable price. [14] This principle is aimed at preventing manufacturers from creating a monopoly on repairs by controlling the supply of essential parts and tools. When parts and tools are readily available, consumers have more choice and can often get their products repaired more quickly and affordably.

**4. Repair Should Not be Hindered by Software:** In an increasingly digital world, software plays a critical role in the functionality of many products. The Right to Repair movement argues that software should not be used to prevent or hinder repairs. [15] This includes the practice of “parts pairing,” where a manufacturer uses software to prevent a product from working if a part is replaced with a non-authorized part. The movement advocates for the right to install custom software and to bypass software locks that prevent repairs.

**5. Design for Repair:** The Right to Repair movement encourages manufacturers to design products that are easy to repair. [16] This includes using modular designs, avoiding the use of glue and other adhesives that make disassembly difficult, and using standard, non-proprietary screws. By designing for repair, manufacturers can extend the lifespan of their products, reduce e-waste, and make repairs more accessible and affordable for consumers.

## 3. Key Practices

The Right to Repair movement employs a variety of practices to achieve its goals, ranging from grassroots activism to legislative advocacy. These practices are designed to raise awareness, pressure manufacturers, and create a more favorable legal and regulatory environment for repair. The following are some of the key practices of the Right to Repair movement:

**1. Legislative Advocacy:** A cornerstone of the Right to Repair movement is the pursuit of legislation that protects the right to repair. [17] This involves lobbying lawmakers at the state and federal levels to introduce and pass Right to Repair bills. These bills typically require manufacturers to make parts, tools, and repair information available to consumers and independent repair shops. The movement has had considerable success in this area, with several states and countries enacting Right to Repair laws. [18]

**2. Grassroots Organizing:** The Right to Repair movement is a grassroots movement that relies on the efforts of volunteers and activists around the world. [19] This includes organizing protests, running public awareness campaigns, and building coalitions with other organizations that share similar goals. Repair cafes, where people can bring their broken electronics and learn how to fix them, are a popular form of grassroots organizing within the movement. [20]

**3. Public Education and Awareness:** The movement places a strong emphasis on educating the public about the importance of the Right to Repair. [21] This includes raising awareness about the environmental impact of e-waste, the economic benefits of repair, and the tactics that manufacturers use to prevent repairs. Organizations like iFixit play a key role in this effort by providing free online repair guides and product teardowns that expose anti-repair designs. [22]

**4. Strategic Litigation:** In some cases, the Right to Repair movement has turned to the courts to challenge the anti-competitive practices of manufacturers. [23] This includes filing lawsuits against companies that engage in monopolistic behavior or violate existing consumer protection laws. While litigation can be a long and expensive process, it can also be an effective way to force manufacturers to change their practices.

**5. Development of Repair-Friendly Products:** Some companies have embraced the principles of the Right to Repair and are designing products that are easy to repair and upgrade. [24] Framework Laptop, for example, is a modular laptop that is designed to be easily repaired and customized by the user. These companies are demonstrating that it is possible to build successful businesses around repair-friendly products.

## 4. Application Context

The Right to Repair movement is relevant in a wide range of contexts, from individual consumers to large-scale industrial operations. The principles and practices of the movement can be applied to any situation where a product is designed to be difficult or impossible to repair. The following are some of the key application contexts for the Right to Repair movement:

**1. Consumer Electronics:** The consumer electronics industry is one of the main focuses of the Right to Repair movement. [25] Smartphones, laptops, and other electronic devices are often designed to be difficult and expensive to repair, leading to a culture of disposability. The Right to Repair movement is working to change this by advocating for more repairable products and greater access to repair information and parts.

**2. Automotive Industry:** The automotive industry has a long history of Right to Repair advocacy. [26] The first Right to Repair laws were passed in the automotive sector, and the industry continues to be a key battleground for the movement. The increasing computerization of cars has created new challenges for independent repair shops, who often lack access to the proprietary diagnostic tools and software needed to repair modern vehicles.

**3. Agricultural Equipment:** The Right to Repair movement has gained significant traction in the agricultural sector, where farmers are often forced to rely on authorized dealers for expensive and time-consuming repairs. [27] This can have a significant impact on a farmer's livelihood, as a broken tractor can bring a harvest to a standstill. The movement is advocating for farmers to have the right to repair their own equipment and to choose their own repair providers.

**4. Medical Devices:** The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical importance of the Right to Repair in the medical field. [28] Hospitals and other healthcare facilities often face significant challenges in repairing and maintaining medical equipment, which can have life-or-death consequences. The Right to Repair movement is working to ensure that healthcare providers have the right to repair their own equipment and to access the necessary parts and information.

**5. Military and Defense:** The Right to Repair is also a critical issue for the military and defense sector. [29] The ability to repair equipment in the field is essential for maintaining operational readiness. The movement is advocating for the military to have greater control over the repair and maintenance of its equipment, rather than being locked into expensive and restrictive contracts with manufacturers.

## 5. Implementation

Implementing the principles of the Right to Repair movement requires a multi-faceted approach that involves legislative action, consumer advocacy, and changes in manufacturer behavior. The following are some of the key steps involved in implementing the Right to Repair:

**1. Passing Right to Repair Legislation:** The most effective way to implement the Right to Repair is to pass legislation that codifies the rights of consumers and independent repair shops. [30] This legislation should require manufacturers to make parts, tools, and repair information available at a reasonable price. It should also prohibit manufacturers from using software locks and other tactics to prevent repairs.

**2. Enforcing Existing Laws:** In addition to passing new legislation, it is also important to enforce existing laws that protect consumers and promote competition. [31] This includes antitrust laws that prohibit monopolistic behavior and consumer protection laws that prohibit unfair and deceptive practices. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has taken a more active role in this area in recent years, sending letters to manufacturers warning them that their repair restrictions may be illegal. [32]

**3. Supporting Repair-Friendly Businesses:** Consumers can play a powerful role in implementing the Right to Repair by supporting businesses that embrace the principles of the movement. [33] This includes buying products from companies that design for repair, and taking their broken products to independent repair shops instead of the manufacturer. By voting with their wallets, consumers can send a clear message to manufacturers that they value repairability.

**4. Promoting a Culture of Repair:** Implementing the Right to Repair also requires a cultural shift away from a throwaway mentality and towards a culture of repair. [34] This includes teaching people the skills they need to repair their own products, and celebrating the value of repair and reuse. Repair cafes and other community-based repair initiatives can play a key role in promoting a culture of repair.

**5. International Cooperation:** The Right to Repair is a global movement, and international cooperation is essential for its success. [35] This includes sharing best practices, coordinating advocacy efforts, and working to create a global standard for repairability. The European Union has taken a leading role in this area, with its Ecodesign Directive and other initiatives aimed at promoting a more circular economy. [36]

## 6. Evidence & Impact

The Right to Repair movement has had a significant and growing impact on consumers, the environment, and the economy. The following are some of the key pieces of evidence and impacts of the movement:

**1. Economic Savings for Consumers:** One of the most significant impacts of the Right to Repair movement is the potential for economic savings for consumers. When consumers are able to repair their own products or take them to an independent repair shop, they can often save a significant amount of money compared to going to the manufacturer. [37] A 2021 study by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) found that Americans could save a collective $40 billion per year if they were able to repair their own electronics. [38]

**2. Reduced E-Waste:** The Right to Repair movement is also having a positive impact on the environment by reducing electronic waste. When products are repaired instead of replaced, it extends their lifespan and keeps them out of landfills. [39] E-waste is the fastest-growing waste stream in the world, and it contains a variety of toxic materials that can harm human health and the environment. [40]

**3. Creation of Local Jobs:** The Right to Repair movement is also helping to create local jobs in the repair industry. [41] When consumers have more choice in where they get their products repaired, it creates more opportunities for independent repair shops to thrive. These small businesses are often an important part of the local economy, providing good-paying jobs and keeping money in the community.

**4. Increased Product Resilience:** The Right to Repair movement is also pushing manufacturers to design more durable and resilient products. [42] When manufacturers know that their products will be repaired, they have a greater incentive to design them to last. This can lead to higher-quality products that are less likely to break in the first place.

**5. Greater Consumer Choice:** Ultimately, the Right to Repair movement is about giving consumers more choice and control over the products they own. [43] When consumers have the right to repair their own products, they are no longer locked into a closed system where the manufacturer controls every aspect of the product's lifecycle. This can lead to a more competitive and innovative market, with a wider range of products and services available to consumers.

## 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

The transition to the Cognitive Era, characterized by the increasing integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning into all aspects of our lives, presents both new challenges and opportunities for the Right to Repair movement. The following are some of the key considerations for the movement in the Cognitive Era:

**1. The Rise of AI-Powered Diagnostics:** AI-powered diagnostic tools have the potential to revolutionize the repair industry, making it easier and faster to diagnose and repair complex problems. [44] However, there is also a risk that these tools could be used to further restrict repairs, with manufacturers using AI to lock down their products and prevent unauthorized access. The Right to Repair movement will need to advocate for open access to AI-powered diagnostic tools and for the right of consumers and independent repair shops to use them.

**2. The Internet of Things and the Right to Repair:** The Internet of Things (IoT) is creating a world where everyday objects are connected to the internet and are constantly collecting and transmitting data. [45] This presents new challenges for the Right to Repair, as manufacturers could use their control over the software that runs these devices to prevent repairs. The movement will need to advocate for the right to repair IoT devices and for the right of consumers to control their own data.

**3. The Role of 3D Printing in Repair:** 3D printing has the potential to democratize the repair process by allowing consumers to print their own replacement parts. [46] This could significantly reduce the cost of repairs and make it easier to repair older products for which parts are no longer available. The Right to Repair movement should work to promote the use of 3D printing in repair and to ensure that consumers have the right to access the digital files needed to print their own parts.

**4. The Need for Digital Literacy:** In the Cognitive Era, the ability to repair a product will increasingly depend on one's digital literacy. [47] The Right to Repair movement will need to work to promote digital literacy and to ensure that everyone has the skills they need to repair their own products. This includes advocating for better education and training in the areas of electronics and computer science.

**5. The Future of Work in the Repair Industry:** The rise of AI and automation will have a significant impact on the future of work in the repair industry. [48] While some repair jobs may be automated, there will also be a growing demand for skilled technicians who can repair and maintain complex AI-powered systems. The Right to Repair movement should work to ensure that the repair industry is prepared for the challenges and opportunities of the Cognitive Era.

### 8. Commons Alignment Assessment (v2.0)

This assessment evaluates the pattern based on the Commons OS v2.0 framework, which focuses on the pattern's ability to enable resilient collective value creation.

**1. Stakeholder Architecture:**
The Right to Repair movement establishes a clear architecture of Rights and Responsibilities. It grants product owners the Right to repair, modify, and access information, while imposing a Responsibility on manufacturers to make parts, tools, and diagnostics available. This framework extends beyond the consumer to include independent repair shops as vital stakeholders, fostering a distributed ecosystem of service providers.

**2. Value Creation Capability:**
The pattern directly enables collective value creation far beyond the initial economic sale. It unlocks economic value for consumers through cost savings and for local businesses through repair services. More importantly, it generates ecological value by extending product lifecycles and reducing e-waste, and fosters knowledge value by promoting repair skills and the open sharing of technical information.

**3. Resilience & Adaptability:**
By decentralizing repair knowledge and capabilities, the pattern makes the entire product ecosystem more resilient. It reduces dependence on single corporate entities, which can be points of failure during supply chain disruptions or when a company ceases operations. This adaptability was highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic, where the right to repair medical equipment was critical for maintaining healthcare capacity under stress.

**4. Ownership Architecture:**
This pattern fundamentally redefines ownership as a bundle of Rights and Responsibilities, moving beyond mere legal title. It asserts that ownership includes the right to understand, maintain, and modify a product. This challenges the emerging model of products-as-a-service where the user has possession but the manufacturer retains ultimate control, thereby strengthening the owner's stake and capability.

**5. Design for Autonomy:**
The principles of Right to Repair are highly compatible with autonomous and distributed systems. By demanding access to diagnostics, data, and software, it provides the necessary foundation for AI-driven diagnostic tools or DAOs to manage and maintain physical assets. Its emphasis on open standards and interoperability lowers the coordination overhead required for third-party and automated agents to interact with and service products.

**6. Composability & Interoperability:**
The pattern is highly composable, serving as a foundational layer for other patterns like Circular Economies, Open Source Hardware, and Community-Based Fabrication (e.g., Repair Cafes). It ensures that products can interoperate with a diverse ecosystem of third-party tools, parts, and service providers, rather than being locked into a single manufacturer's proprietary system. This enables the creation of larger, more complex, and more resilient value-creation systems.

**7. Fractal Value Creation:**
The logic of Right to Repair applies fractally across multiple scales. At the individual scale, it's the right to fix your own phone. At the community scale, it enables local repair shops and economies. At the industrial and national scale, it applies to critical infrastructure, agricultural equipment, and military hardware, ensuring operational autonomy and resilience. The core principle of owning your own technology and being able to maintain it is universally applicable.

**Overall Score: 4 (Value Creation Enabler)**

**Rationale:**
The Right to Repair movement is a powerful enabler of collective value creation. It establishes the critical stakeholder architecture and ownership model needed for a resilient, adaptable, and sustainable product ecosystem. While it doesn't create a complete value creation architecture on its own, it provides the foundational rights and access that make such architectures possible.

**Opportunities for Improvement:**
- The pattern could be strengthened by integrating formal mechanisms for data ownership and portability, ensuring users control the data their products generate.
- It could more explicitly connect with governance patterns to help communities manage shared repair infrastructure and knowledge commons.
- Developing standards for repairability scoring and labeling could further empower consumers and create market incentives for manufacturers to design for longevity.
