# 1. Overview

Community Land Ownership (CLO) is a transformative approach to land tenure that separates the ownership of land from the ownership of the buildings and other improvements upon it. In a CLO model, a nonprofit, community-based organization acquires and holds title to land for the collective benefit of a defined community. This land is then leased, typically through long-term, renewable ground leases, to individuals, families, or cooperative entities for residential, commercial, or agricultural purposes. The primary goals of Community Land Ownership are to ensure permanent housing affordability, prevent displacement, and foster community control over local development. By removing land from the speculative market, CLO creates a stock of permanently affordable housing and other community assets, thereby promoting racial and economic equity and building community wealth.

The historical roots of Community Land Ownership in the United States are deeply intertwined with the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. The first Community Land Trust (CLT), New Communities, Inc., was established in Georgia in 1969 by Black farmers seeking to secure access to land in the face of systemic discrimination and economic exploitation [1]. This pioneering model demonstrated the potential of collective land ownership to provide economic stability and self-determination for marginalized communities. Since then, the CLO model has evolved and expanded, moving from rural to urban contexts and adapting to address a wide range of community needs, from affordable housing and small business incubation to urban agriculture and neighborhood revitalization. Today, a "fourth wave" of community ownership is emerging, characterized by innovative financing mechanisms and an expansion into commercial real estate, all in service of building a more just and equitable solidarity economy [2].

# 2. Core Principles

The practice of Community Land Ownership is grounded in a set of core principles that distinguish it from conventional models of real estate and land development. These principles are fundamental to achieving the goals of permanent affordability, community empowerment, and equitable development.

**Decommodification of Land:** At the heart of the CLO model is the principle of treating land as a shared resource rather than a commodity to be bought and sold for profit. By taking land off the speculative market, CLOs disrupt the dynamics that drive up housing costs and lead to displacement. This decommodification is achieved by separating the ownership of land from the ownership of the improvements on it, allowing the community to retain control over the land in perpetuity.

**Permanent Affordability:** A key objective of Community Land Ownership is to create and preserve housing and other community assets that are affordable for current and future generations. This is accomplished through the use of long-term ground leases and resale formulas that limit the sale price of homes and other properties. While homeowners can build equity, a portion of that equity is reinvested in the property to ensure that it remains affordable for the next buyer, thus creating a stock of permanently affordable housing.

**Community Control and Democratic Governance:** CLOs are fundamentally democratic organizations that are governed by and for the community they serve. The typical governance structure of a CLT, for example, includes a board of directors composed of residents, community members, and public stakeholders. This tripartite structure ensures that the organization remains accountable to the community and that decisions about land use and development reflect the needs and priorities of local residents.

**Shared Equity and Risk:** The CLO model is based on a principle of shared equity and risk. Homeowners and other leaseholders have the opportunity to build wealth through the equity in their homes, but this individual wealth-building is balanced with the community's interest in preserving long-term affordability. Similarly, the risks associated with land ownership and development are shared between the community organization and the individual leaseholders, creating a more resilient and supportive ecosystem for all.

# 3. Key Practices

Several key practices are central to the successful implementation of the Community Land Ownership model. These practices work in concert to achieve the core principles of decommodification, affordability, and community control.

**Land Acquisition and Banking:** The foundational practice of any CLO is the acquisition of land. This can be accomplished through various means, including purchase on the open market, donation, or transfer from public agencies. Once acquired, the land is effectively “banked” by the community organization, removing it from the speculative market and holding it in trust for the benefit of the community.

**Ground Leasing:** Instead of selling the land, CLOs utilize long-term, renewable ground leases to convey the right to use the land to individuals, families, or other entities. These ground leases, which typically have a term of 99 years, provide the leaseholder with secure tenure and the right to own and use the improvements on the land. The ground lease also contains provisions that ensure the property remains affordable and is used in a manner consistent with the community’s goals.

**Resale Formulas:** To ensure permanent affordability, CLOs employ resale formulas that govern the sale of homes and other properties. These formulas are designed to balance the homeowner’s desire to earn a fair return on their investment with the community’s need to keep the property affordable for the next buyer. The specific formula can vary, but it typically limits the appreciation of the home to a predetermined rate, ensuring that the subsidy is passed on to subsequent generations of low- and moderate-income families.

**Community Organizing and Capacity Building:** A successful CLO is built on a foundation of strong community engagement and organizing. This involves bringing residents and other stakeholders together to develop a shared vision for their community, identify local needs and priorities, and build the collective capacity to govern and manage the land and assets. This ongoing process of community building is essential for the long-term success and sustainability of the CLO.

**Stewardship:** CLOs have a responsibility to act as long-term stewards of the land and the affordability of the improvements upon it. This involves monitoring compliance with the terms of the ground lease, providing support to homeowners and other leaseholders, and intervening to prevent foreclosure and preserve the affordability of the properties. This stewardship role is critical to ensuring that the benefits of community ownership are realized for generations to come.

# 4. Application Context

Community Land Ownership is a versatile model that can be applied in a wide range of contexts to address various community needs. Its flexibility allows it to be adapted to different geographic settings, market conditions, and community goals.

**Urban and Rural Settings:** While the first CLTs were established in rural areas to support Black farmers, the model has since been widely adopted in urban and suburban communities. In cities, CLOs are a powerful tool for combating gentrification and displacement, creating affordable housing in high-cost markets, and promoting equitable transit-oriented development. In rural areas, CLOs can be used to preserve farmland, support local agriculture, and provide affordable housing for farmworkers and other rural residents.

**Affordable Housing:** The most common application of the CLO model is the creation and preservation of affordable housing. By separating the cost of land from the cost of housing, CLOs can significantly reduce the purchase price of a home, making homeownership accessible to low- and moderate-income families who would otherwise be priced out of the market. The resale restrictions ensure that these homes remain affordable in perpetuity, creating a valuable community asset.

**Commercial and Economic Development:** Community Land Ownership is increasingly being used to support local economies and promote equitable commercial development. Commercial CLTs can provide affordable, stable storefronts for small businesses, incubate worker-owned cooperatives, and create community-serving enterprises. By giving the community a stake in commercial development, CLOs can help to ensure that economic growth benefits existing residents and businesses, rather than leading to their displacement.

**Community Facilities and Green Space:** In addition to housing and commercial development, CLOs can be used to create and preserve a wide range of community facilities and green spaces. This can include everything from community centers and childcare facilities to parks, community gardens, and urban farms. By placing these assets under community control, CLOs can ensure that they are managed and maintained in a way that meets the needs of the local community.

# 5. Implementation

The implementation of a Community Land Ownership model is a complex, multi-stage process that requires careful planning, community engagement, and a long-term commitment. The process can be broken down into four distinct phases:

**Phase 1: Community Organizing & Visioning:** The first and most critical phase is to build a strong, inclusive, and representative base of community support. This involves reaching out to residents, local organizations, and other stakeholders to raise awareness about the CLO model and its potential benefits. Through a series of community meetings, workshops, and one-on-one conversations, a shared vision for the community is developed, and the specific goals of the CLO are defined. This grassroots organizing is essential for ensuring that the CLO is truly community-led and accountable.

**Phase 2: Legal & Financial Structuring:** Once a core group of community members is committed to moving forward, the next phase is to establish the legal and financial infrastructure of the CLO. This typically involves incorporating as a nonprofit organization, drafting bylaws that reflect the democratic governance structure of the organization, and securing tax-exempt status. At the same time, the organization must develop a comprehensive business plan and begin the process of securing start-up funding and financing for land acquisition. This may involve a combination of grants, loans, and community-based fundraising.

**Phase 3: Land Acquisition & Development:** With the legal and financial structures in place, the CLO can begin the process of acquiring land. This may involve purchasing property on the open market, negotiating the transfer of publicly owned land, or accepting donations of land. Once the land is acquired, the CLO works with community members and development partners to plan and implement the development of the property in accordance with the community's vision. This could involve the construction of new affordable housing, the rehabilitation of existing buildings, or the creation of commercial spaces or community facilities.

**Phase 4: Stewardship & Governance:** The implementation of a CLO does not end with the completion of the development phase. In fact, the work of stewardship and governance is ongoing and perpetual. The CLO is responsible for managing the land and ensuring that the terms of the ground leases are upheld. This includes providing support to homeowners and other leaseholders, monitoring the resale of properties to ensure their continued affordability, and managing the organization's finances and operations. The democratic governance structure of the CLO ensures that the community remains in control of the land and assets for generations to come.

# 6. Evidence & Impact

The impact of Community Land Ownership is well-documented, with a growing body of research demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving a range of positive economic, social, and civic outcomes. The evidence base, while strongest for residential CLTs, increasingly points to the broader benefits of community control over land and real estate assets.

**Economic Benefits:** One of the most significant and well-documented impacts of the CLO model is its ability to increase access to and retention of homeownership for low- and moderate-income households. Studies have shown that CLT homeowners are significantly less likely to experience foreclosure than their counterparts in the conventional market, even during times of economic crisis such as the 2008 recession [2]. This stability allows families to build wealth and financial security. Furthermore, by providing affordable commercial spaces, CLOs can support the growth of locally owned small businesses, which in turn creates jobs and strengthens the local economy. Research indicates that locally owned businesses have a "multiplier effect," circulating more money within the community and contributing to greater income and employment growth [2].

**Social and Civic Benefits:** The benefits of Community Land Ownership extend beyond the economic realm. By creating and preserving affordable housing, CLOs help to combat displacement and maintain the social fabric of neighborhoods. This stability allows residents to build strong social ties and a sense of community. The democratic governance structure of CLOs also fosters civic engagement and leadership development. Residents who participate in the governance of a CLO gain valuable skills and experience in community organizing, decision-making, and financial management. This increased civic capacity can have a ripple effect, empowering residents to advocate for their interests in other areas of local policy and planning [2].

**Built Environment and Resilience:** CLOs can have a tangible impact on the built environment of a community. They can transform vacant and underutilized lots into productive community assets, such as affordable housing, community gardens, and parks. By promoting infill development and the rehabilitation of existing buildings, CLOs can contribute to the creation of more vibrant, walkable, and sustainable neighborhoods. Moreover, the CLO model can enhance a community's resilience to climate change and other shocks. By providing stable, affordable housing, CLOs can reduce the vulnerability of low-income households to displacement from climate-related events. They can also support the development of green infrastructure and other climate adaptation measures [2].

# 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

The transition to the Cognitive Era, characterized by the increasing integration of digital technologies, data, and artificial intelligence into all aspects of society, presents both new opportunities and challenges for the Community Land Ownership model. To remain relevant and effective in this new context, CLOs must consider how to leverage these emerging technologies to enhance their work and further their mission.

**Digital Platforms for Engagement and Governance:** The Cognitive Era offers the potential to deepen and broaden community engagement in CLOs through the use of digital platforms. Online portals, mobile applications, and social media can be used to disseminate information, facilitate discussions, and solicit input from a wider range of community members. Digital tools can also be used to streamline the governance of CLOs, enabling online voting, virtual board meetings, and more transparent and accessible decision-making processes. The rise of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and other blockchain-based governance models also presents an intriguing, though still experimental, frontier for CLOs to explore new forms of collective ownership and democratic control.

**Data-Driven Planning and Impact Assessment:** The proliferation of data in the Cognitive Era can empower CLOs to make more strategic and data-informed decisions. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and other data analysis tools can be used to identify suitable properties for acquisition, assess community needs, and model the potential impacts of different development scenarios. CLOs can also leverage data to more effectively track and communicate their impact, using key metrics to demonstrate their success in creating affordable housing, preventing displacement, and building community wealth. This data-driven approach can help CLOs to make a more compelling case for support from funders, policymakers, and the public.

**Smart Homes and Sustainable Communities:** The Cognitive Era is also driving the development of smart home technologies and other innovations that can enhance the sustainability and quality of life in CLO communities. Smart home devices can help residents to reduce their energy consumption and utility costs, while also improving the comfort and safety of their homes. At the community scale, CLOs can explore the use of microgrids, district energy systems, and other smart infrastructure to create more resilient and sustainable neighborhoods. By embracing these technologies, CLOs can not only improve the lives of their residents but also contribute to the broader goals of climate justice and environmental sustainability.

# 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

Community Land Ownership is a pattern that is deeply aligned with the principles of the commons. By taking land out of the speculative market and placing it under community stewardship, CLOs create a new type of commons that is managed for the collective good. This assessment evaluates the alignment of the CLO model with the seven key dimensions of a commons.

| Dimension | Alignment | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Shared Resource** | High | The land owned by a CLO is a clearly defined shared resource that is managed for the benefit of a specific community. |
| **2. Community Governance** | High | CLOs are governed by a democratic body that includes residents, community members, and other stakeholders, ensuring that the resource is managed in a way that is accountable to the community. |
| **3. Rules and Norms** | High | The use of the land is governed by a clear set of rules and norms, which are codified in the ground lease and the organization's bylaws. These rules are designed to ensure the long-term affordability and sustainability of the resource. |
| **4. Monitoring and Enforcement** | Medium | CLOs have mechanisms in place to monitor compliance with the rules and to enforce them when necessary. However, the capacity for monitoring and enforcement can vary depending on the size and resources of the organization. |
| **5. Sanctions and Conflict Resolution** | Medium | CLOs have procedures for addressing violations of the rules and for resolving conflicts among members. These procedures are typically designed to be fair and transparent, but their effectiveness can depend on the specific context. |
| **6. Mutual Aid and Support** | High | The CLO model fosters a strong sense of community and mutual support among residents. The organization often provides assistance to homeowners to prevent foreclosure and to help them succeed as homeowners. |
| **7. Polycentric Governance** | Medium | CLOs often collaborate with other organizations, including government agencies, financial institutions, and other nonprofits, to achieve their goals. However, the extent of this collaboration can vary, and there is a need for greater coordination and support for the CLO movement as a whole. |

**Overall Commons Alignment Score: 3 (Strongly Aligned)**

Community Land Ownership is a powerful model for creating and managing a land commons. Its high degree of alignment with the core principles of the commons makes it a valuable tool for building more just, equitable, and sustainable communities.
