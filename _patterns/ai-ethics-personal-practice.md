Develop a personal ethical framework for your use of AI—what you'll delegate, what you won't, how you'll maintain skills and authenticity.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on AI Ethics.

---

### Section 1: Context

You work in a field transformed by accessible AI. The ecosystem is neither stable nor collapsing—it's differentiating rapidly. In corporate settings, teams are shipping AI-assisted products without shared ethical anchors, creating fragmentation between what leadership permits and what workers feel comfortable doing. Governments are scrambling to write policies while practitioners move faster than regulation. Activist organizations face a paradox: AI tools could amplify their reach, yet outsourcing decision-making to opaque systems betrays their mandate for transparency. Tech teams building AI products operate in the hottest domain, where ethical clarity is both most urgent and most absent.

Across all four contexts, individual practitioners carry the load. You're the one deciding whether to let an LLM draft a performance review, write code, create content, or analyze sensitive data. Your organization may have governance frameworks or policies, but they're often abstract—written for compliance, not for lived work. The real choice-making happens in your hands, in the moment, with incomplete information and time pressure. This is where the commons breaks down: each person invents their own ethics privately, without collective learning, creating islands of practice rather than a resilient stewarded system.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Ethics vs. Practice.**

You want to use AI to amplify your work and stay current with your field. AI tools are genuinely useful—they accelerate research, reduce tedium, and surface patterns you'd miss alone. But you also sense a erosion beneath the productivity. Delegate too much, and your skills atrophy. Your judgment becomes brittle. You lose the felt sense of the work. You can't catch errors that AI makes because you never learned to do it yourself. Your authenticity—the thing that made you valuable—dissolves into curation and editing.

Yet refusing AI entirely is a different kind of cost. You fall behind. You burn out on tasks that machines could handle. You become less useful to your team and less competitive in your field. You can't collaborate with colleagues who've integrated AI into their workflow. The tension isn't philosophical—it's material.

The deeper problem: you have no shared framework for making these choices. Your organization offers no guidance beyond vague "use responsibly." Your profession hasn't codified which tasks preserve core skill and which don't. So you make ad-hoc decisions, second-guessing yourself, without feedback loops or collective learning. You're isolated in your ethics, reinventing the wheel each time. Over time, this isolation either hardens into dogma or erodes into rationalization.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, articulate and document your personal delegation boundaries—which cognitive tasks you will reserve, which you will share with AI, and what practices you'll use to stay sharp and authentic.**

This pattern works by making your ethics explicit and visible, turning a private struggle into a stewarded practice. Here's the mechanism:

First, explicitness creates accountability. When you write down "I will not delegate client-facing diagnosis; I will use AI to flag patterns I've already learned to see," you create a constraint that catches you when you're rationalizing. The written boundary is a root system—it anchors your choices when you're tired or pressured.

Second, documentation becomes a commons seed. Your boundaries aren't universal rules; they're calibrated to your role, domain, and risk tolerance. But when you articulate them—in a shared document, on a team wiki, in a conversation with peers—others learn. They either adopt your boundaries, adapt them, or explicitly choose different ones. Either way, the system gains texture. Collective learning becomes possible.

Third, regular review creates adaptive capacity. Your boundaries won't be perfect the first time. As you use them, you'll discover edge cases, unforeseen harms, new opportunities. A quarterly or bi-annual refresh lets the pattern evolve. You're not rigid; you're resilient. The system can respond to changing conditions—new AI capabilities, new regulatory pressure, new insights about skill decay.

Fourth, embedded practices maintain vitality. This isn't just a thought exercise. You build specific acts into your workflow: weekly "work without AI" blocks where you do core tasks unassisted; monthly skills audits where you test whether you can still do what you've delegated; quarterly conversations with peers about where your boundaries have shifted. These practices are the photosynthesis—they're what keeps the system alive and responsive.

The source traditions in AI Ethics emphasize transparency and human agency. This pattern operationalizes those values in a way that survives contact with real work.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**Start with an audit.** Spend a week noticing where you use AI in your work. Don't change anything yet; just track. Write down: task name, current AI use (if any), skill level required, stakes if done wrong, consequences if you never do it yourself again. This raw data is your foundation.

**Map your delegation tiers.** Create three categories:

*Core skills I will never delegate.* These are tasks so fundamental to your role or identity that losing them means losing yourself. A therapist doesn't delegate active listening. A doctor doesn't delegate diagnosis. A painter doesn't delegate color choice. These tasks stay human-led, always. Name 3–5 of these ruthlessly.

*Shared tasks where AI assists my judgment.* These are where the pattern generates real value. You do the core cognitive work; AI surfaces patterns, drafts variants, catches obvious errors. A researcher reviews AI-suggested citations but doesn't trust them blindly. A manager uses AI to summarize feedback but writes the performance narrative themselves. A writer uses AI for structural suggestions but owns the voice. These tasks have clear checkpoints where you re-engage your judgment.

*Routine work I can delegate more fully.* Email sorting, scheduling, data entry, literature formatting, meeting transcription summaries. These have lower stakes and lower skill-building value. You can delegate them further, but still maintain spot-checks. You still know how to do them; you just don't do them often.

**Write your declaration.** For each tier, write 2–3 sentences that explain *why* you've drawn the line there. Not "it's important" but specific: "I won't delegate client communication because I need to hear voice and hesitation to catch what isn't being said." "I will use AI to draft code structure but write security-critical sections myself because that's where breaches happen." This reasoning is the compass—it helps you navigate new tasks that don't fit neatly into your original categories.

**Anchor it in your context:**

- **Corporate**: Share your boundaries with your manager and team. Ask them to hold you to them. Include your delegation tiers in your personal development plan. When your company introduces a new AI tool, apply your framework before adopting it: does this task belong in tier 1, 2, or 3? Propose this to your team as a template.

- **Government**: Build your boundaries into your agency's AI procurement criteria. When evaluating tools, ask: which core functions in our mandate must stay human-led? Draft a memo for your policy team using your framework—it models how individual practitioners can inform governance without waiting for policy to arrive first.

- **Activist**: Document your boundaries as part of your organization's AI principles. Use it in trainings: "Here's how one of us decided what to delegate." The specificity matters more than universal rules. Share it with allied organizations—other activists will adapt it, and that cross-pollination strengthens the whole ecosystem.

- **Tech**: If you're building AI products, use your personal framework to stress-test the system you're creating. Where might users lose skill? Where might they rationalize harm? Document your own boundaries and share them in design critiques. Ask your team to do the same. This isn't philosophy; it's user research about authentic use.

**Establish review cadence.** Monthly, scan your work logs and ask: did I respect my boundaries? Where did I slip? Why? Quarterly, revisit the boundaries themselves. Has anything shifted? Have you discovered a new skill-decay risk? Update the declaration. This is maintenance, not punishment.

**Create accountability partners.** Find 1–2 peers in your field (or a study group if you can't find them) who are also practicing this. Meet every 6 weeks. Share: where you've held the line, where you've wavered, where you've learned something new. This transforms a solitary practice into a commons. You're no longer inventing ethics alone.

---

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

You develop a clear sense of which skills matter most to you and protect them actively. This sharpens your identity and your value in your field. You're not just "the person who uses AI"—you're "the person who uses AI thoughtfully, and still knows how to do X when it matters." Your judgment strengthens because you're exercising it deliberately, in the places where it counts most.

Your relationships with peers shift. Instead of everyone secretly wondering if they're using AI "right," you're now naming shared dilemmas and learning together. Trust increases. You can collaborate more honestly. And when you share your boundaries with colleagues, some will adapt them; that collective learning prevents the system from fragmenting into individual rationalization.

Your work gains integrity. You're not trying to hide AI use or pretend you did something you didn't. You're explicit: "I used AI for this, and here's why I'm confident in the result." Clients, colleagues, and stakeholders can trust your transparency. The work itself feels more authentic because you're not haunted by doubt about whether you actually did it.

**What risks emerge:**

Your boundaries can harden into dogma. You wrote "I will never delegate client-facing work" six months ago, and now you're spending 40 hours a week on routine client emails that an AI could triage, freeing you for deeper work. Rigidity kills vitality. The pattern generates decay when the declaration becomes a script instead of a living practice.

Isolation can persist. You have clear boundaries, but you're not actually talking to anyone about them. Your declaration sits in a document. No one learns from it; no collective commons emerges. The pattern only generates resilience if boundaries are shared and adapted.

Skill maintenance is harder than it sounds. You write down "I will code the security-critical sections," but then you go 6 months without doing it because there's no new security module. You've lost the skill you were protecting. The pattern requires real time investment, not just declarations. If you don't build in practice—weekly sessions where you do the core work unassisted—the whole structure decays.

The commons assessment notes resilience at 3.0 (moderate risk). Ownership is also 3.0, which signals a real vulnerability: if this is a purely personal practice, it's fragile. It only becomes resilient when it's woven into team or organizational practice. A solitary ethical framework is noble but fragile.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Story 1: The Research Analyst (Corporate)**

Sarah is a market analyst at a financial services firm. Six months ago, her team adopted an AI tool that could generate first drafts of research summaries from earnings calls. She wrote her boundaries: (1) she would always listen to the calls herself, (2) she would review AI summaries but never publish them unread, (3) she would write her own thesis and investment rationale, (4) she would delegate only routine cite-checking and data formatting.

She documented this and shared it with her manager. Now, when the team discusses the new AI tool, Sarah has a template. Two colleagues adopted almost her exact framework; one colleague modified it to delegate more (they're more comfortable with AI analysis). The result: the team isn't pretending the tool doesn't exist, and they're not blindly trusting it either. When a recent AI summary misread a CEO's tone, Sarah caught it because she'd listened to the call. The pattern protected the team's credibility.

**Story 2: The Policy Advocate (Government)**

Marcus works for an environmental agency. His unit needs to review thousands of permit applications. AI could accelerate the work, but permits determine what gets built. He drafted his boundaries: core environmental judgment stays human-led; AI flags patterns and surfaces high-risk cases; humans make final determinations.

He documented this and shared it with his director. Now, the agency's AI procurement process asks: "Which decisions are core to our mandate?" Marcus's framework became the language for that conversation. When another federal agency asked how to implement AI in permitting, Marcus's agency had a model. The pattern spread horizontally across government, without waiting for policy to be written.

**Story 3: The Product Engineer (Tech)**

Dev is a backend engineer at an AI company building code-completion tools. She noticed her own team using the company's tool to write code, sometimes without understanding what they'd generated. She articulated boundaries for herself: review every AI-suggested function; write security-critical code yourself; use AI for boilerplate and structure; test everything thoroughly.

Then she did something important: she shared these boundaries with her design team and asked, "What does a user who follows these boundaries look like? Are we designing for them?" This forced the product team to think about skill decay in their users. They added features—explainability, step-through debugging, suggested challenges—that made the tool more responsible. Dev's personal practice influenced product design.

---

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

AI introduces new depth to this pattern because the stakes are higher and the surface area is wider. You're not just deciding whether to use a tool; you're deciding what parts of your cognition to externalize.

In the AI era, the core tension shifts subtly. It's no longer just "efficiency vs. skill retention." It's now "alien cognition vs. human judgment." When AI generates output, it's not just faster—it's made by a different intelligence, trained on patterns you can't fully see. The question becomes: at what point does delegating to AI mean delegating your agency? When do you become a validator of someone else's choices rather than a chooser yourself?

This creates new boundary work. You need to distinguish between:
- Tasks where AI can augment your judgment without replacing it
- Tasks where AI's opacity makes delegation irresponsible
- Tasks where AI could do better than you, but losing the skill would hollow your role

The tech context is key here. If you're working *with* AI as a tool, you have more agency. If the AI is black-box or if you're expected to trust it without understanding, you've lost leverage. Your boundaries need to account for transparency and explainability, not just efficiency.

The distributed intelligence landscape also changes ownership. Your personal practice no longer affects only you—it affects what gets trained on, what users expect, what becomes normalized. If you use AI to ghostwrite client emails, and that becomes visible, it shifts client expectations across your industry. Your personal boundaries have commons implications.

New leverage: AI tools themselves can help you maintain your framework. Logging and auditing tools can track what you've delegated and what you've kept. AI can help you test your own skills—"write this without assistance, then compare to AI output." The tool can support the practice that resists over-reliance on the tool.

---

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

You notice you're making deliberate trade-offs, not rationalizations. When you delegate something, you can name why, and it aligns with your written boundaries. When you refuse to delegate, the choice feels protective, not stubborn. Your skills in your core areas are sharp—you're using them regularly, and you're catching AI errors because you know the work deeply.

Conversations with peers have texture. People ask you, "Why did you draw that boundary?" and you have real answers, not just anxiety. You've noticed colleagues adapting your framework or sharing their own. There's a commons emerging. The pattern isn't living inside you alone; it's moving through the team or community.

You're updating your boundaries because you've learned something, not because you're abandoning them. Maybe you discovered that you *can* delegate the skill you thought was core, or that you shouldn't have delegated something you did. The revisions feel like adaptive responses, not failure.

**Signs of decay:**

Your declaration is a year old and you haven't touched it. You're following boundaries by rote, without checking whether they still fit. New AI capabilities have emerged, but you haven't reconsidered what that means for your boundaries. The practice has become ritual instead of alive.

You're not talking to anyone about it. Your boundaries live in a document no one else has seen. When colleagues ask about your AI use, you give vague answers. The commons never formed; it's still a solitary practice. Isolation makes it fragile.

You're slipping regularly—delegating things you said you wouldn't—but you're not investigating why. You tell yourself it's an exception, but it's happened three times this month. The pattern has become performative. You have the declaration, but you're not living it.

**When to replant:**

If you notice the pattern has become hollow or you've drifted far from your original boundaries, schedule a full refresh: re-audit your work, re-map your tiers, re-write your declaration. Don't just tweak; go back to the root. This usually takes 4–6 weeks.

If the pattern has been living well but the world has shifted—new AI capabilities, new regulatory requirements, new role change—replant by doing a quarterly deep review instead of a monthly scan. That concentrated attention will surface what needs to evolve.
