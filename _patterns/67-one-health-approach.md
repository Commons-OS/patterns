### 1. Overview (150-300 words)

The One Health approach is an integrated, unifying framework for balancing and optimizing the health of people, animals, and ecosystems. It recognizes the inextricable link between human health, animal health, and the environment, advocating for a collaborative, multisectoral, and transdisciplinary approach to address complex health challenges. The core problem that One Health seeks to solve is the siloed nature of health disciplines, which often fails to address the root causes of diseases that span across species and ecosystems. By breaking down these silos, One Health creates value by enabling more effective disease surveillance, prevention, and control, as well as promoting a more holistic understanding of health.

The concept of One Health has a long history, with its roots tracing back to the 19th century. Rudolf Virchow, a German physician, was one of the first to recognize the link between human and animal health, coining the term "zoonosis" to describe diseases transmitted between animals and humans. The term "One Health" itself was later popularized in the early 2000s, following a series of conferences and publications that highlighted the need for a more integrated approach to global health. The Wildlife Conservation Society's 2004 symposium, which produced the 12 "Manhattan Principles," was a key moment in the development of the One Health movement. This was followed by the formalization of the approach by international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH).


### 2. Core Principles (3-7 principles, 200-400 words)

The One Health approach is guided by a set of core principles that provide a framework for its implementation. At its heart is the principle of **interdependence of health**, which recognizes that the health of humans, animals, and the environment are inextricably linked. This principle acknowledges that changes in one domain can have significant impacts on the others, and that a holistic approach is necessary to achieve optimal health outcomes for all. Building on this, the principle of **transdisciplinary collaboration** emphasizes the importance of collaboration among experts from a wide range of disciplines, including medicine, veterinary medicine, environmental science, public health, and social sciences. This collaborative approach is essential for understanding and addressing the complex challenges that arise at the intersection of human, animal, and environmental health.

The One Health approach is also grounded in **systems thinking**, which involves understanding the complex interconnections and feedback loops within a system. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of health challenges and the development of more effective and sustainable solutions. Furthermore, the One Health approach relies on a **scientific and evidence-based approach**, using a strong scientific foundation and evidence to inform decision-making. This includes conducting research to better understand the drivers of disease, developing and evaluating interventions, and monitoring the impact of One Health initiatives. Finally, a core principle of One Health is the commitment to **equity and social justice**. This means ensuring that the benefits of One Health are distributed fairly and that vulnerable populations are not disproportionately affected by health threats. It also involves addressing the social and economic determinants of health that contribute to health disparities.


### 3. Key Practices (5-10 practices, 300-600 words)

The One Health approach is put into action through a series of key practices that translate its principles into tangible outcomes. **Joint surveillance and information sharing** is a cornerstone of this approach, involving the establishment of integrated surveillance systems that collect and share data on human, animal, and environmental health. For example, a joint surveillance system might track the incidence of a zoonotic disease in both human and animal populations, allowing for early detection and response. When a disease outbreak does occur, a **coordinated outbreak response** is essential, involving all relevant sectors. This might include joint investigation teams, shared laboratory resources, and coordinated communication strategies.

To support these practices, **cross-sectoral policy and legislation** are crucial. One Health promotes the development of policies and legislation that address health challenges in a holistic manner. For example, a government might enact legislation that requires collaboration between the ministries of health, agriculture, and environment on issues related to food safety. To build the necessary capacity for One Health, **joint education and training** opportunities are essential for professionals from different disciplines. This might include joint degree programs, cross-disciplinary workshops, and field training exercises.

Engaging the public and local communities is another key practice for promoting One Health. **Public awareness and community engagement** can involve public awareness campaigns, community-based surveillance programs, and participatory research projects. A major focus of One Health is the **prevention and control of zoonotic diseases**, which includes a range of practices such as vaccination of animal populations, control of disease vectors, and promotion of safe animal handling practices. The One Health approach is also critical for addressing the growing threat of **antimicrobial resistance (AMR) stewardship**, with key practices including promoting the responsible use of antimicrobials in both human and animal medicine, as well as reducing the environmental spread of AMR. Finally, One Health plays a vital role in ensuring **food safety and security** through a farm-to-fork approach that addresses potential hazards at all stages of the food chain, from production to consumption.


### 4. Application Context (200-300 words)

The One Health approach is best used for addressing complex health challenges that span across human, animal, and environmental domains. It is particularly well-suited for tackling emerging infectious diseases, many of which are zoonotic in origin. By integrating surveillance systems, the One Health approach enables early detection and rapid response to new disease threats. It is also essential for combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a complex problem that requires a coordinated effort to manage the use of antimicrobials in both human and animal medicine. Furthermore, the One Health framework is crucial for ensuring food safety and security, as it allows for the identification and mitigation of risks at all stages of the food production and distribution chain. In recent years, the One Health approach has also been increasingly applied to address the health impacts of environmental factors, such as climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss. It can also enhance preparedness and response to intentional biological threats, such as bioterrorism and agroterrorism.

However, the One Health approach is not a panacea for all health problems. It is less applicable to non-communicable diseases that have no clear environmental or animal link, such as those that are primarily genetic or lifestyle-related. In cases of acute medical emergencies, such as trauma or heart attacks, the immediate focus is on clinical care, and a One Health approach is not directly relevant.

The One Health approach can be applied at all scales, from the individual and team level to the organizational, multi-organizational, and ecosystem levels. It is relevant to a wide range of domains, including public health, veterinary medicine, environmental science, agriculture, food safety, wildlife management, and international development.


### 5. Implementation (400-600 words)

Successful implementation of the One Health approach hinges on several key prerequisites. Strong political will and leadership are essential at all levels of government, including a commitment to inter-sectoral collaboration and the allocation of sufficient resources. Engaging a wide range of stakeholders, including government agencies, academic institutions, private sector organizations, and civil society groups, is also crucial to ensure that all relevant perspectives are considered and that there is broad support for the One Health approach. Finally, a clear legal and policy framework is needed to support One Health collaboration, which may include formal agreements between government agencies and legislation that mandates inter-sectoral cooperation.

Getting started with the One Health approach involves several concrete steps. A key first step is to establish a national One Health platform or coordinating mechanism to bring together representatives from all relevant sectors to facilitate communication, collaboration, and joint planning. It is also important to conduct a thorough situation analysis and stakeholder mapping to identify the key health challenges and potential partners. Based on this analysis, a national One Health strategic plan should be developed, outlining the goals, objectives, and activities of the program, as well as the roles and responsibilities of the different partners. Starting with pilot projects can be an effective way to demonstrate the value of the One Health approach and to build momentum for broader implementation.

Despite its benefits, the implementation of One Health is not without its challenges. One of the biggest challenges is the siloed nature of many institutions, which can be a barrier to collaboration. Overcoming these barriers requires a concerted effort to promote a culture of collaboration and to reform institutional structures. Lack of resources, including funding and human resources, can also be a major obstacle. It is important to advocate for increased investment in One Health and to explore innovative financing mechanisms. Data sharing and interoperability can also be challenging due to technical, legal, and institutional barriers. It is important to develop common data standards and to establish clear data sharing agreements.

Several factors are critical for the success of the One Health approach. Strong governance and coordination are essential, including a clear mandate for the One Health platform and dedicated staff and resources. A shared vision and common goals that are understood and supported by all partners are also important to ensure that everyone is working towards the same objectives. Building trust and strong relationships between partners is another critical success factor, which takes time and effort but is essential for effective collaboration. Finally, a robust monitoring and evaluation system is needed to track progress, to identify challenges, and to make necessary adjustments to the One Health program.


### 6. Evidence & Impact (300-500 words)

The One Health approach has been widely adopted by a number of leading international and national organizations. The World Health Organization (WHO) has been a major proponent of the approach, integrating it into many of its programs, particularly in the areas of emerging infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) works closely with the WHO and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) to promote the One Health approach in the context of food safety, animal health, and sustainable agriculture. The WOAH, in turn, is a key partner in the global One Health movement and plays a leading role in setting standards for animal health and welfare. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a dedicated One Health Office that works to promote the approach across the agency and with partners at the state and local levels. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) also has a long history of applying a One Health approach to address the health of livestock and poultry, as well as to ensure the safety of the food supply. The World Bank has also recognized the economic benefits of the One Health approach and has invested in a number of One Health projects around the world.

The adoption of the One Health approach has led to a number of documented outcomes. It has been shown to improve the early detection and response to zoonotic disease outbreaks, with joint surveillance programs being successful in detecting avian influenza and other emerging threats. By preventing and controlling zoonotic diseases, the One Health approach can also help to reduce the significant economic losses that these diseases can cause to the livestock industry and other sectors. Furthermore, the One Health approach has led to improvements in food safety by promoting a more holistic approach to food production and by strengthening collaboration between the public health and agriculture sectors.

A large and growing body of research supports the benefits of the One Health approach. The One Health High-Level Expert Panel (OHHLEP) provides scientific advice to the Quadripartite partners on One Health priority setting, policies, and strategies. Numerous academic studies have also been published in a wide range of journals, including the Lancet, the Journal of the American Medical Association, and the Public Library of Science (PLOS), documenting the effectiveness of the One Health approach.


### 7. Cognitive Era Considerations (200-400 words)

The One Health approach stands to be significantly augmented by the advent of cognitive technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). These technologies offer the potential to analyze vast and complex datasets from human, animal, and environmental sources, enabling the identification of patterns and the prediction of disease outbreaks. For instance, AI-powered surveillance systems could monitor social media and news reports for early indications of disease emergence, while ML algorithms could be employed to model the spread of zoonotic diseases and pinpoint high-risk areas.

Despite the power of AI and other cognitive technologies, they are not a replacement for human expertise. The interpretation of data and the formulation of effective interventions will continue to rely on the knowledge and experience of professionals from a wide array of disciplines. The crucial aspect will be to strike the right balance between human and machine, leveraging technology to augment human capabilities and to free up valuable time for more strategic and creative endeavors.

Looking ahead, the One Health approach is poised to become increasingly data-driven and predictive in the cognitive era. The growing availability of real-time data from diverse sources, coupled with the power of AI and ML, will facilitate a more proactive and targeted approach to health challenges. We can also anticipate the emergence of new tools and platforms that streamline collaboration and data sharing between different sectors, further dismantling the silos that have traditionally impeded the implementation of One Health.


### 8. Commons Alignment Assessment (600-800 words)

1.  **Stakeholder Mapping**: The One Health approach inherently calls for a broad and inclusive approach to stakeholder mapping. It recognizes that health challenges are complex and interconnected, and that a wide range of actors have a stake in the health of humans, animals, and the environment. This includes not only government agencies and healthcare professionals, but also farmers, community leaders, private sector actors, and civil society organizations. However, the extent to which all relevant stakeholders are included in practice can vary depending on the specific context and the resources available.

2.  **Value Creation**: The One Health approach creates value in a number of ways. By promoting a more holistic and integrated approach to health, it can lead to more effective disease prevention and control, which in turn can reduce healthcare costs and economic losses. It can also create value by promoting a more sustainable and resilient food system, and by protecting the environment. The benefits of One Health are broadly distributed, although some stakeholders may benefit more than others. For example, farmers may benefit from improved animal health and productivity, while communities may benefit from a reduced risk of zoonotic diseases.

3.  **Value Preservation**: The One Health approach helps to preserve value by promoting a more proactive and preventative approach to health. By addressing the root causes of disease and by building resilience in our health systems, it can help to avoid the high costs associated with disease outbreaks and other health crises. The relevance of the One Health approach is maintained over time by its ability to adapt to new and emerging health challenges, such as climate change and antimicrobial resistance.

4.  **Shared Rights & Responsibilities**: The One Health approach is based on the principle of shared responsibility for health. It recognizes that all stakeholders have a role to play in protecting the health of humans, animals, and the environment. However, the distribution of rights and responsibilities can be complex and contested. For example, there may be disagreements about who is responsible for the costs of disease surveillance and control, or about how to balance the rights of farmers with the need to protect public health.

5.  **Systematic Design**: The One Health approach is a systematic approach to health that is based on the principles of systems thinking. It seeks to understand the complex interconnections between human, animal, and environmental health, and to design interventions that are tailored to the specific context. The implementation of One Health is enabled by a range of systems and processes, including joint surveillance systems, coordinated outbreak response mechanisms, and cross-sectoral policy frameworks.

6.  **Systems of Systems**: The One Health approach is a prime example of a system of systems. It brings together multiple, independent systems from the human health, animal health, and environmental sectors to create a more effective and resilient overall system. The One Health approach can be composed with other patterns, such as community-based surveillance and participatory governance, to create even more powerful solutions.

7.  **Fractal Properties**: The principles of the One Health approach can be applied at all scales, from the local to the global. At the local level, a community might implement a One Health project to address a specific health challenge, such as rabies control. At the national level, a government might establish a national One Health platform to coordinate the activities of different ministries. At the global level, international organizations such as the WHO, FAO, and WOAH work together to promote the One Health approach and to address global health challenges.

**Overall Score**: 3

The One Health approach is a transitional pattern that has the potential to be highly aligned with the principles of the commons. It is based on a holistic and collaborative approach to health that recognizes the interconnectedness of all living things. However, the implementation of One Health can be challenging, and there is a risk that it could be co-opted by powerful interests. To improve its commons alignment, it is important to ensure that the One Health approach is implemented in a way that is equitable, participatory, and accountable to all stakeholders.
