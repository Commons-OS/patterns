### 1. Overview

Steward-Ownership is a legal and financial framework that redefines corporate ownership to ensure a company's long-term independence and purpose. The Steward-Ownership Governance - Purpose Foundation Model is a specific implementation of this framework, where a foundation holds a 'golden share' with veto power to protect the company's core principles. This model is designed to solve the fundamental problem of shareholder primacy, where the pressure to maximize short-term profits for shareholders can often conflict with a company's long-term mission, values, and the well-being of its stakeholders. By legally separating voting rights from economic rights, steward-ownership ensures that control of the company remains with individuals who are actively involved in and committed to its purpose—the 'stewards'—rather than with those who simply provide capital. This structure allows the company to prioritize its mission, reinvest profits into its operations and stakeholders, and make decisions that support its long-term health and sustainability. The concept of steward-ownership has been practiced for over a century, with early examples like the Bosch and Carlsberg foundations. The Purpose Foundation has been instrumental in popularizing and creating accessible legal frameworks for steward-ownership, including the Golden Share model, to help a new generation of mission-driven companies protect their purpose.

### 2. Core Principles

The Steward-Ownership Governance model is built upon a set of fundamental principles that redefine the relationship between a company, its owners, and its purpose. These principles are legally embedded in the company's structure to ensure its long-term adherence to its mission.

1.  **Self-Governance and Independence**. Control of the company remains with the stewards, who are chosen for their commitment to the company's mission, not their capital contribution. Voting rights are separated from economic rights and cannot be sold or inherited, ensuring the company's independence from speculative pressures.

2.  **Profits Serve Purpose**. Profits are a means to an end, not the end itself. They are reinvested in the business, shared with stakeholders, or donated to charity, ensuring the company's financial success serves its purpose.

3.  **Long-Term Orientation**. Freed from short-term profit demands, the company can focus on long-term value creation, innovation, and resilience, building strong stakeholder relationships.

4.  **Equitable Value Distribution**. Value is shared among all stakeholders who contribute to its creation, including employees, customers, and the community, fostering a more inclusive form of capitalism.

### 3. Key Practices

The Steward-Ownership Governance - Purpose Foundation Model is put into practice through a series of legal and organizational mechanisms that ensure the model's principles are upheld.

1.  **Golden Share with Veto Power**. A non-profit entity holds a 'golden share' with the power to veto any changes to the company's steward-ownership structure, acting as a permanent guardian of its purpose.

2.  **Dual-Class Share Structure**. The company creates two classes of shares: steward shares with voting rights but no economic rights, and investor/founder shares with economic rights but no voting rights.

3.  **Steward Committee and Succession**. A Steward Committee, composed of individuals committed to the company's mission, holds the voting control. A clear succession plan ensures that stewardship is passed on to capable and aligned successors.

4.  **Defined Profit Allocation and Capped Returns**. The company's articles of association define how profits are allocated, with a focus on reinvestment and stakeholder value. Returns to investors are often capped to prevent the profit motive from overriding the company's purpose.

5.  **Mission-Locked Articles of Association**. The company's mission and steward-ownership principles are legally embedded in its articles of association, making them difficult to change.

### 4. Application Context

The Steward-Ownership Governance model, particularly the Purpose Foundation variant, is a versatile framework that can be applied in various contexts. However, its suitability depends on the specific goals, values, and circumstances of the organization.

- **Best Used For**:
    - **Mission-Driven Startups**: For new ventures where the founders are deeply committed to a social or environmental mission, this model provides a robust way to protect that mission from the dilutive pressures of conventional venture capital. It allows them to raise capital without compromising their long-term vision.
    - **Family Business Succession**: When a family-owned business is facing a generational transition, steward-ownership offers a powerful alternative to a sale or passing control to heirs who may not be interested or capable. It preserves the company's legacy, values, and independence for the long term.
    - **Mature Businesses Seeking Alternatives to Exit**: For successful, privately-held companies where the owners wish to retire or exit, this model provides a way to ensure the company's continued independence and mission-driven focus, rather than being absorbed by a larger corporation or private equity firm.
    - **Platform Cooperatives and Digital Commons**: In the digital economy, steward-ownership can be used to create platforms and services that are governed in the interest of their users and contributors, rather than for the profit of a few shareholders. It provides a legal framework for building a more equitable and democratic digital commons.

- **Not Suitable For**:
    - **Hyper-Growth, Exit-Focused Ventures**: Companies whose primary goal is to achieve rapid, exponential growth and then be sold for a massive profit (the "unicorn" model) will find steward-ownership to be incompatible with their objectives. The model is designed for long-term sustainability, not short-term exit value.
    - **Founders Seeking to Maximize Personal Wealth**: If the founders' main motivation is to extract the maximum possible personal wealth from the business, steward-ownership is not the right choice. It requires a commitment to reinvesting profits into the company and its purpose.

- **Scale**: The Steward-Ownership Governance model is primarily applied at the **Organization** level, as it defines the legal and governance structure of the entire company. It can also be extended to a **Multi-Organization/Ecosystem** level, where a network of steward-owned companies collaborates to create a more purpose-driven economy.

- **Domains**: Steward-ownership is being successfully applied across a wide range of industries, demonstrating its adaptability. Notable domains include:
    - **Technology**: Companies like Ecosia and Sharetribe use steward-ownership to ensure their platforms serve their users and a broader social purpose.
    - **Manufacturing**: Legacy companies like Bosch and Zeiss have operated under steward-ownership principles for decades, demonstrating the model's long-term viability.
    - **Consumer Goods**: Patagonia's recent transition to a steward-ownership structure highlights the model's appeal for brands with strong ethical and environmental commitments.
    - **Food and Agriculture**: Companies in the organic and sustainable food movement are adopting steward-ownership to protect their values and resist consolidation by large agribusinesses.
    - **Healthcare**: The Dutch home-care organization Buurtzorg is a prominent example of how steward-ownership can be used to create more patient-centered and employee-empowered healthcare models.

### 5. Implementation

Implementing the Steward-Ownership Governance - Purpose Foundation Model is a transformative process that requires careful planning and execution.

- **Prerequisites**: A deep commitment from founders, a clear purpose, and expert legal and financial advice are essential.

- **Getting Started**: The process involves educating stakeholders, assessing the legal and financial situation, designing the new structure, creating a transition plan, and executing the legal changes.

- **Common Challenges**: Finding aligned investors, navigating legal complexity, and managing the cultural shift are common hurdles.

- **Success Factors**: Success depends on strong leadership, robust governance, engaged stewards, and transparent communication.
### 6. Evidence & Impact

The Steward-Ownership Governance model has a long and successful history, with a growing body of evidence demonstrating its positive impact on companies, stakeholders, and the broader economy.

- **Notable Adopters**:
    - **Bosch (Germany)**: One of the earliest and most prominent examples of steward-ownership, Bosch has been operating under this model for over a century. This structure has enabled the company to become a global leader in technology and services, with a strong focus on innovation and long-term sustainability.
    - **Carlsberg (Denmark)**: The Carlsberg Foundation, a steward-owner of the Carlsberg Group, has ensured the company's long-term focus on quality and scientific research. The foundation's support has been instrumental in the company's global success.
    - **Novo Nordisk (Denmark)**: A leading global healthcare company, Novo Nordisk is another example of the Danish foundation-owned model. This structure has allowed the company to make long-term investments in research and development, leading to groundbreaking treatments for diabetes and other chronic diseases.
    - **Patagonia (USA)**: In 2022, Patagonia's founder, Yvon Chouinard, transferred ownership of the company to a specially designed trust and a nonprofit organization. This move ensures that the company's profits will be used to combat climate change and protect the planet, cementing its legacy as a leader in corporate environmentalism.
    - **Ecosia (Germany)**: The search engine that uses its profits to plant trees is a prime example of a modern, digitally-native steward-owned company. Its legal structure ensures that it can never be sold and that its profits will always be used to support its environmental mission.
    - **Sharetribe (Finland)**: A platform for building online marketplaces, Sharetribe transitioned to steward-ownership to protect its mission of democratizing the sharing economy. This move has allowed the company to build a more equitable and collaborative platform for its users.

- **Documented Outcomes**:
    - **Increased Long-Term Focus**: Studies have shown that steward-owned companies are more likely to have a long-term orientation, investing in research and development, employee training, and sustainable practices.
    - **Greater Resilience**: By retaining profits and focusing on long-term health, steward-owned companies are often more resilient to economic downturns and financial crises.
    - **Higher Employee Satisfaction and Retention**: The focus on purpose and stakeholder value creation often leads to higher employee satisfaction, engagement, and retention rates.
    - **Enhanced Innovation**: The freedom from short-term profit pressure allows steward-owned companies to invest in more radical and long-term innovation projects.

- **Research Support**:
    - **The Purpose of the Corporation Project**: Research from this project at the Said Business School, University of Oxford, has highlighted the benefits of purpose-driven and steward-owned models of corporate governance.
    - **The European Commission**: A 2022 study commissioned by the European Commission explored the potential of steward-ownership to promote a more sustainable and equitable economy.
    - **Purpose Foundation Research**: The Purpose Foundation and its network of researchers have published numerous reports and case studies documenting the implementation and impact of steward-ownership across various industries and jurisdictions.

### 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

The Steward-Ownership Governance model is well-positioned to navigate the Cognitive Era. AI can enhance decision-making, automate governance, and personalize stakeholder engagement. However, the uniquely human qualities of stewardship—empathy, ethical judgment, and creativity—remain irreplaceable. Steward-owned companies can lead in ethical AI governance, and the model may evolve to integrate with DAOs or even utilize AI as a steward, reinforcing the need for purpose-driven organizations in an increasingly automated world.

### 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

The Steward-Ownership Governance model, particularly when implemented with the Purpose Foundation as a golden shareholder, demonstrates a significant alignment with the principles of a commons-based economy. This assessment evaluates the pattern against the seven dimensions of commons alignment.

1.  **Stakeholder Mapping**: The model inherently promotes a comprehensive mapping of stakeholders. By separating voting and economic rights, it forces a conscious decision about who should have a voice in the company's governance. The stewards, who hold the voting control, are chosen for their connection to the company's mission, and often include representatives from various stakeholder groups, such as employees, customers, and community members. This is a significant departure from the conventional model, where the only stakeholder that truly matters is the shareholder.

2.  **Value Creation**: Steward-ownership shifts the focus of value creation from maximizing shareholder wealth to creating value for a broader set of stakeholders. The "profits serve purpose" principle ensures that the financial value generated by the company is reinvested to further its mission, improve its products and services, and benefit its employees and the community. This model recognizes that value is co-created by all stakeholders and seeks to distribute it more equitably.

3.  **Value Preservation**: The model is explicitly designed for long-term value preservation. The de-commodification of the enterprise, achieved through the non-transferable nature of voting rights and the golden share veto, protects the company from being sold or dismantled for short-term gain. This ensures that the company's purpose, values, and stakeholder relationships are preserved for future generations.

4.  **Shared Rights & Responsibilities**: Steward-ownership provides a clear framework for distributing rights and responsibilities. The stewards have the right and responsibility to govern the company in a way that is true to its purpose. Investors have the right to a fair return on their investment, but not the right to control the company. Employees have the right to a fair wage and good working conditions, and in some cases, a share of the profits. This clear and equitable distribution of rights and responsibilities is a hallmark of a commons-based approach.

5.  **Systematic Design**: The Steward-Ownership Governance model is a systematic design for a purpose-driven enterprise. The legal and governance structures are carefully designed to create a system where the company's purpose is the central organizing principle. The dual-class share structure, the golden share, the Steward Committee, and the defined profit allocation are all interconnected components of a system that is designed to be self-perpetuating and resilient.

6.  **Systems of Systems**: Steward-owned companies can be seen as building blocks for a larger "system of systems"—a purpose-driven economy. As more companies adopt this model, they can create a network of aligned organizations that can collaborate to address complex social and environmental challenges. The Purpose Foundation itself acts as a hub for this network, providing support, resources, and a shared identity for steward-owned companies.

7.  **Fractal Properties**: The principles of steward-ownership can be applied at different scales, demonstrating fractal properties. A single team or department within a larger organization could be structured as a steward-owned unit, with its own purpose, stewards, and stakeholder agreements. This would allow for greater autonomy and purpose-driven decision-making at all levels of the organization.

**Overall Score: 4/5 (Commons-Aligned)**

The Steward-Ownership Governance - Purpose Foundation Model is a powerful example of a commons-aligned approach to corporate governance. It provides a robust legal and financial framework for creating companies that are purpose-driven, stakeholder-oriented, and built for the long term. While it is not a perfect solution, and its implementation can be challenging, it represents a significant step towards a more equitable and sustainable economy.

**Opportunities for Improvement**:

While the model is strong, there are opportunities to further enhance its commons alignment. These include developing more robust mechanisms for stakeholder participation in governance, creating more innovative financing models that are even more aligned with the principles of a commons, and fostering a stronger ecosystem of support for steward-owned companies.
