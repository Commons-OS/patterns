# Empathy Mapping

## 1. Overview

Empathy Mapping is a collaborative tool used to gain a deeper understanding of a target audience, be it customers, users, or other stakeholders. It is a visual representation of what a team knows about a user, helping to create a shared understanding of their needs and to inform decision-making processes. The map is typically divided into four quadrants—Says, Thinks, Does, and Feels—with the user or persona at the center. This structure provides a holistic view of the user's experience, capturing not just their explicit statements and actions but also their internal thoughts and emotions.

## 2. Core Principles

The fundamental principle of Empathy Mapping is to foster empathy for the user. By externalizing knowledge about users, teams can move beyond their own assumptions and biases, and develop a more user-centric perspective. The core principles that underpin this practice include:

The fundamental principle of Empathy Mapping is to foster empathy for the user. By externalizing knowledge about users, teams can move beyond their own assumptions and biases, and develop a more user-centric perspective. This is achieved through a set of core principles. **Shared understanding** is promoted as empathy maps are created collaboratively, bringing together diverse perspectives from across a team. This process helps to build a shared understanding of the user, ensuring that everyone is aligned on who they are designing for. This collaborative approach breaks down silos and encourages a more unified team dynamic. The practice is inherently **user-centered**, placing the user at the heart of the empathy map, focusing on understanding their world, experiences, and motivations, a cornerstone of design thinking. This principle ensures that the design process is driven by user needs, rather than by the assumptions of the design team. A **holistic view** is encouraged, considering not just what users say and do, but also what they think and feel, providing a more complete picture of their experience and revealing valuable insights from conflicts and inconsistencies. This multi-faceted approach allows teams to uncover the deeper motivations and pain points that drive user behavior. Ultimately, the goal is to generate **actionable insights** that can inform design decisions, identifying opportunities to improve the user experience and create more value by understanding their pains and gains. These insights provide a clear and compelling rationale for design choices, making it easier to gain buy-in from stakeholders.

## 3. Key Practices

The practice of Empathy Mapping involves a series of key practices, from gathering research to synthesizing insights. The process begins with **defining the scope and goals**, which involves identifying the user or persona to be mapped and the primary purpose of the exercise. This initial step is crucial for ensuring that the empathy mapping exercise is focused and productive. A clear scope and well-defined goals will guide the team throughout the process and help to ensure that the resulting empathy map is relevant and actionable. This is followed by **gathering research**, as empathy maps are fueled by qualitative research such as user interviews, field studies, and diary studies; the richer the research, the more insightful the map. It is important to gather a variety of data from different sources to ensure that the empathy map is comprehensive and accurate. The research should focus on understanding the user's experiences, motivations, and pain points in their own context. **Collaborative mapping** is a central practice, where the map is created by the team, with members individually generating ideas and then clustering them, fostering participation and shared understanding. This collaborative process is essential for building a shared understanding of the user and for ensuring that all team members feel a sense of ownership over the resulting empathy map. The use of a large whiteboard and sticky notes can facilitate this process, allowing team members to visually organize their ideas and to identify connections and patterns. The team then **synthesizes and analyzes** the information, looking for patterns, themes, and inconsistencies to uncover key insights. This is a critical step in the process, as it is where the team moves from raw data to actionable insights. The team should look for recurring themes, as well as for any surprising or contradictory findings. These can often be the source of the most valuable insights. Finally, the map is **polished and a plan is made** for its use, which may include digitization and creating a plan for how it will inform the design process. The polished empathy map should be a clear and concise summary of the team's understanding of the user. It should be easily accessible to all team members and should be used to guide design decisions throughout the project. A plan should also be created for how the empathy map will be updated and refined over time, as new information becomes available.

## 4. Application Context

Empathy Mapping is a versatile tool that can be applied in a variety of contexts to foster a deeper understanding of users. It is most effective when used at the beginning of the design process, as it helps to align the team and ensure that the design is grounded in user needs. However, it can be used throughout the design process to revisit user needs and to gut-check design decisions.

Empathy Mapping is a versatile tool applicable in various contexts to foster a deeper understanding of users. It is most effective when used at the beginning of the design process to align the team and ground the design in user needs, but it can be used throughout the process to revisit user needs and validate design decisions. The application of empathy mapping extends across various domains, each with its unique benefits. In **product and service design**, empathy maps are widely used to understand user needs and inform the design of new offerings, as well as to improve existing ones by identifying pain points and opportunities. By providing a clear and concise summary of the user's experience, empathy maps can help designers to create products and services that are more intuitive, effective, and enjoyable to use. In **marketing and sales**, they help develop more effective strategies by creating a deeper understanding of the customer's perspective, leading to more targeted and persuasive messaging. By understanding what customers are thinking, feeling, and doing, marketers can create campaigns that are more relevant and engaging. For **organizational change**, empathy maps can facilitate the process by helping employees understand the perspectives of different stakeholders, which can build consensus and reduce resistance to change. By creating a shared understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with a change initiative, empathy maps can help to build a sense of shared purpose and to foster a more collaborative and supportive environment.

## 5. Implementation

The implementation of Empathy Mapping is a collaborative process that unfolds in a series of structured steps. It begins with **defining the scope**, which includes identifying the user or persona and the primary purpose of the exercise to ensure relevance and usefulness. This initial framing is critical for a successful outcome. The next step is to **gather research**, as empathy maps are fueled by qualitative research like user interviews and field studies; a variety of rich data is crucial for a comprehensive and accurate map. The quality and depth of the research directly impact the quality of the empathy map. Once research is gathered, the team **generates ideas**, typically by individually writing them on sticky notes and then sharing and discussing them as a group. This brainstorming phase is a divergent thinking activity, where the goal is to generate a wide range of ideas without judgment. The ideas are then **clustered and synthesized** into the four quadrants of the map—Says, Thinks, Does, and Feels—to organize the information and identify patterns, themes, and insightful inconsistencies. This is a convergent thinking activity, where the team works together to make sense of the data and to identify the most important themes. Finally, the team **synthesizes needs and insights** from the clustered information. Needs represent the user's goals and desires, while insights are the 'aha' moments that can lead to design breakthroughs, making this step crucial for translating the empathy map into actionable outcomes. This final step is what transforms the empathy map from a simple data collection tool into a powerful tool for innovation.
## 6. Evidence & Impact

Empathy Mapping has been shown to have a positive impact on a variety of outcomes, including team alignment, user understanding, and design effectiveness. A study on the use of empathy mapping in nursing education found that it enhanced students' empathy and self-confidence in communication. The study concluded that this teaching approach facilitated deeper and broader student learning, enhancing both empathy and communication confidence. The teaching materials developed in this study can be employed in future courses to teach empathy and patient communication effectively [1].

In addition to its impact on individual learning, Empathy Mapping can also have a positive impact on team dynamics. By providing a shared understanding of the user, it can help to align team members and to reduce the potential for bias and unfounded assumptions. This can lead to more effective collaboration and to better design outcomes.

## 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

In the Cognitive Era, where technology is increasingly able to understand and to respond to human emotions, Empathy Mapping is more relevant than ever. As AI and other cognitive technologies become more prevalent, it is essential that we design them in a way that is empathetic to human needs and values. Empathy Mapping can help us to do this by providing a framework for understanding the user's emotional experience.

Furthermore, the rise of big data and analytics provides new opportunities to enrich Empathy Mapping with quantitative data. By combining qualitative insights from Empathy Mapping with quantitative data on user behavior, we can develop a more complete and nuanced understanding of the user. This can help us to create more personalized and effective user experiences.

### 8. Commons Alignment Assessment (v2.0)

This assessment evaluates the pattern based on the Commons OS v2.0 framework, which focuses on the pattern's ability to enable resilient collective value creation.

**1. Stakeholder Architecture:**
Empathy Mapping focuses on understanding a target audience, which can include various stakeholders like customers, users, or even internal employees. It implicitly defines a responsibility for the team using the map to consider the perspective of the mapped stakeholder. However, it doesn't explicitly define rights for the stakeholders being mapped, nor does it have a built-in mechanism to account for non-human stakeholders like the environment.

**2. Value Creation Capability:**
The pattern directly enables the creation of "knowledge value" by fostering a shared understanding of a stakeholder. This understanding can then lead to the creation of other forms of value, such as improved social value (better services), economic value (more successful products), and resilience value (by designing systems that are more aligned with user needs).

**3. Resilience & Adaptability:**
By creating a deeper understanding of user needs and context, Empathy Mapping helps teams design products and services that are more resilient to changing user expectations. It's a tool that helps a system (the team or organization) adapt its offerings by maintaining coherence with the needs of its users.

**4. Ownership Architecture:**
The pattern does not directly address ownership in terms of rights and responsibilities. It's a tool for understanding, not for defining ownership structures. The "ownership" of the insights generated is implicitly held by the team that creates the map.

**5. Design for Autonomy:**
Empathy Mapping is a human-centric, collaborative process that requires significant coordination. While the insights from an empathy map could be used to design autonomous systems (like AI agents that better understand human emotions), the pattern itself is not inherently designed for low coordination overhead or direct compatibility with autonomous systems. It's a tool for humans to design for others (who could be humans or autonomous agents).

**6. Composability & Interoperability:**
Empathy Mapping is highly composable. It's a foundational tool in Design Thinking and User-Centered Design, and it can be combined with many other patterns like Personas, Journey Mapping, and Business Model Canvas to build more comprehensive value-creation systems.

**7. Fractal Value Creation:**
The logic of Empathy Mapping can be applied at multiple scales. A team can create an empathy map for an individual user, a customer segment, a partner organization, or even an entire community. The process of understanding the "Says, Thinks, Does, Feels" can be scaled up or down.

**Overall Score: 4 (Value Creation Enabler)**

**Rationale:**
Empathy Mapping is a powerful tool for building the shared understanding that is foundational to collective value creation. It excels at creating knowledge value and fostering a user-centric perspective, which in turn leads to more resilient and valuable products and services. However, it does not provide a complete architecture for value creation, as it lacks explicit mechanisms for defining stakeholder rights, ownership, and is not inherently designed for autonomous systems.

**Opportunities for Improvement:**
- Integrate mechanisms for stakeholders to co-create and validate their own empathy maps, shifting from a team-centric to a more participatory process.
- Develop extensions to the Empathy Map framework that explicitly consider the rights and responsibilities of all stakeholders, including non-human ones like the environment.
- Explore how the insights from Empathy Maps can be translated into formal rules or parameters for autonomous agents and DAOs, bridging the gap between human-centric understanding and machine execution.
