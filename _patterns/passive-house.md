# Passive House

## 1. Overview

Passive House (Passivhaus) is a voluntary building performance standard for very high energy efficiency and thermal comfort that substantially reduces a building’s carbon footprint. [1] Buildings certified to the standard are ultra-low energy and typically require very little energy for space heating or cooling. The approach is used for housing and for non-residential buildings such as offices, schools, kindergartens and healthcare facilities. Energy efficiency is integral to architectural design rather than an add-on. Although most common in new construction, the principles are also applied in deep renovations.

## 2. Core Principles

**Passive House** is a design and construction methodology centered on five core principles that work together to dramatically reduce energy consumption for heating and cooling while creating a comfortable and healthy indoor environment. These principles are not a prescriptive checklist but a holistic, performance-based approach that is adapted to the specific climate and context of each project.

A continuous layer of insulation around the entire building envelope (walls, roof, and floor) is the first line of defense against heat loss in cold climates and heat gain in warm climates. Passive House buildings typically feature insulation levels that are two to three times greater than what is required by conventional building codes. This “superinsulation” strategy significantly reduces the amount of energy needed to maintain a comfortable interior temperature, enhances acoustic comfort, and increases the building's resilience to power outages.

Uncontrolled air leakage through gaps and cracks in the building envelope can account for a significant portion of a building's energy loss and can lead to moisture problems and drafts. Passive House standards require a very high level of airtightness, verified by a blower-door test. This is achieved through careful design and construction, using a continuous air barrier membrane and sealing all joints and penetrations. A virtually airtight envelope prevents the infiltration of unconditioned outside air and the exfiltration of conditioned inside air, leading to significant energy savings and improved comfort.

Windows and doors are typically the weakest link in the building envelope from a thermal perspective. Passive House buildings use high-performance glazing systems, typically triple-paned with low-emissivity (low-e) coatings, inert gas fills (such as argon or krypton), and thermally broken frames. These advanced glazing systems minimize heat loss in the winter and heat gain in the summer, while still allowing for passive solar heat gain when desired. The result is a more stable and comfortable interior environment, with warmer window surfaces that eliminate cold drafts and condensation.

A thermal bridge is a pathway for heat to flow through the building envelope, bypassing the insulation. These can occur at junctions between building elements, such as where walls meet floors or roofs, or where structural elements penetrate the insulation layer. Passive House design aims to eliminate thermal bridges through careful detailing and construction. This ensures that the insulation layer is truly continuous and that the building performs as designed, without cold spots that can lead to condensation and mold growth.

Because Passive House buildings are so airtight, they require a mechanical ventilation system to provide a continuous supply of fresh, filtered air. To minimize the energy penalty associated with ventilation, these systems use a heat recovery ventilator (HRV) or an energy recovery ventilator (ERV). An HRV transfers heat from the stale exhaust air to the incoming fresh air, while an ERV transfers both heat and moisture. This process recovers a significant portion of the energy that would otherwise be lost through ventilation, while ensuring excellent indoor air quality.
## 3. Key Practices

The five core principles of Passive House are put into practice through a range of specific design and construction techniques. These practices are not applied in isolation but are integrated into a holistic building system where each component contributes to the overall performance. The implementation of continuous insulation is a primary practice, often achieved by applying insulation to the exterior of the structure to minimize thermal bridging and protect it from temperature fluctuations. Insulating the foundation and slab with a thick layer of rigid foam is also critical to prevent heat loss to the ground, while roofs are insulated to a very high level with blown-in insulation or multiple layers of rigid foam.

Airtightness is achieved through the use of a continuous air barrier system, which can be created with specialized membranes, tapes, and liquid-applied coatings. This barrier is carefully detailed to be continuous across all building components, and all penetrations for pipes, wires, and ducts are meticulously sealed. Blower door tests are conducted at various stages of construction to identify and seal any air leaks, ensuring that the final building meets the stringent airtightness requirements.

High-performance glazing is another key practice. Windows are installed in a way that minimizes thermal bridging and ensures a continuous air and water barrier, often by placing the window in line with the insulation layer. The building is also oriented to take advantage of passive solar heat gain in the winter, with larger windows on the south-facing facade. In the summer, shading strategies, such as overhangs or external blinds, are used to prevent overheating.

Thermal bridge-free design is achieved by carefully detailing all junctions between building components to minimize thermal bridging. Structural connections that penetrate the insulation layer are minimized or thermally broken to reduce heat loss.

Finally, heat recovery ventilation is implemented through a balanced ventilation system with a high heat recovery rate. The ductwork for the ventilation system is designed and installed to be airtight and to minimize pressure drops, ensuring that the system operates efficiently.
## 4. Application Context

The Passive House standard is not a prescriptive building code but a performance-based standard that can be applied to a wide range of building types and climate zones. The specific design and construction strategies used to achieve the Passive House standard will vary depending on the local climate, building typology, and other project-specific factors. While the name "Passive House" might suggest that the standard is only applicable to single-family homes, it has been successfully applied to a wide variety of building types, including residential buildings such as single-family homes, multi-family apartment buildings, and student dormitories; commercial buildings such as offices, retail stores, and supermarkets; institutional buildings such as schools, kindergartens, and healthcare facilities; and even industrial buildings such as fire stations and warehouses.

The Passive House standard is applicable to all climate zones, from the cold of the arctic to the heat and humidity of the tropics. However, the specific design strategies will vary significantly depending on the climate. In cold climates, the focus is on minimizing heat loss through a superinsulated and airtight envelope, and maximizing passive solar heat gain. In warm climates, the focus is on minimizing solar heat gain through shading and a well-insulated envelope, and on providing efficient cooling and dehumidification. In hot and dry climates, the focus is on minimizing solar heat gain and on using thermal mass to moderate temperature swings. In hot and humid climates, the focus is on minimizing solar heat gain and on providing efficient dehumidification.
## 5. Implementation

The implementation of a Passive House project follows a structured process that begins with design and continues through construction and certification. The key to a successful project is an integrated design process that involves close collaboration between the architect, builder, and a certified Passive House consultant. The design phase begins with engaging a certified Passive House consultant and setting a certification goal. The consultant then uses energy modeling software, such as the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP), to create an energy model of the building and inform design decisions. The design team works together to integrate the five core principles of Passive House into the building design, including decisions about the building's form and orientation, the selection of materials and components, and the detailing of all building envelope connections.

The construction phase requires a high level of quality control to ensure that the building is built to the design specifications. This includes regular site visits by the Passive House consultant and blower door testing to verify airtightness. The proper installation of all components, especially the insulation, air barrier, and windows, is critical to the performance of the building. The construction process is carefully documented to provide evidence of compliance with the Passive House standard.

The certification phase concludes with a final blower door test to verify that the building meets the airtightness requirements. The project team then submits all required documentation to the certification body for review. Once the certification body has verified that the project meets all of the requirements, the building is awarded Passive House certification.

## 6. Evidence & Impact

The Passive House standard has a proven track record of delivering significant energy savings, improved occupant health and comfort, and long-term cost-effectiveness. The performance of Passive House buildings has been extensively monitored and documented in numerous studies and real-world projects around the world. Passive House buildings typically consume up to 90% less energy for heating and cooling than conventional buildings. This dramatic reduction in energy consumption is achieved through the five core principles of Passive House design, which work together to create a highly efficient building envelope and ventilation system. The energy savings from Passive House buildings have been verified in numerous studies and are a key driver for the adoption of the standard.

Passive House buildings also provide a superior level of occupant health and comfort compared to conventional buildings. This is due to a number of factors, including excellent indoor air quality from the continuous supply of fresh, filtered air from the heat recovery ventilation system; thermal comfort from the superinsulated and airtight envelope and high-performance windows; and acoustic comfort from the high level of insulation and airtightness. While Passive House buildings may have a slightly higher upfront construction cost, this is typically offset by the long-term energy savings. The payback period for the additional investment in a Passive House building is often less than 10 years. In addition, Passive House buildings have lower maintenance costs and are more resilient to power outages and extreme weather events.

## 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

The principles of Passive House design are highly compatible with the emerging technologies of the cognitive era, including smart home automation, building sensors, and data analytics. The integration of these technologies can further enhance the performance, comfort, and resilience of Passive House buildings. Smart home automation systems can be used to optimize the performance of a Passive House building by automating ventilation control, temperature and humidity management, and energy monitoring and optimization. Building sensors can be used to collect data on a wide range of parameters, which can be analyzed to identify opportunities for improving the performance of the building and to provide feedback to the occupants on their energy use. The combination of Passive House design and cognitive era technologies can create buildings that are highly resilient and adaptable to a changing climate. For example, a Passive House building with a smart energy management system can be designed to operate off-grid during a power outage, providing a safe and comfortable shelter for its occupants.

## 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

The Passive House standard exhibits a strong alignment with the principles of the commons, particularly in its emphasis on knowledge sharing, resource stewardship, and community resilience. The standard's openness and transparency are demonstrated through the public availability of design guides, case studies, and training materials from both the Passive House Institute (PHI) and the Passive House Institute US (PHIUS). The decentralized and federated system of certification bodies allows for adaptation to local climates and building practices while maintaining quality and consistency. Resource stewardship is at the core of the standard, with its focus on dramatically reducing energy consumption, conserving natural resources, and promoting the use of durable and sustainable materials. The vibrant and collaborative Passive House community fosters knowledge sharing and best practices through conferences, workshops, and online forums. While the upfront cost of a Passive House building can be higher, the long-term energy savings can make it more affordable over the life of the building, and the improved indoor air quality and thermal comfort can have a positive impact on the health and well-being of occupants, promoting social equity and inclusion. The economic viability of Passive House is well-established, with a significant return on investment from energy savings and reduced long-term ownership costs. Finally, by reducing energy consumption and promoting the use of sustainable materials, Passive House buildings can contribute to ecological regeneration, and be a platform for, ecological regeneration.
