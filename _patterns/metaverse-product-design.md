## 2. Core Principles

The design of products for the metaverse is guided by a set of core principles that address the unique challenges and opportunities of this immersive digital frontier. These principles, adapted from research by Forrester and other industry experts, provide a framework for creating engaging, intuitive, and valuable metaverse experiences.

### 1. Fusion

The principle of **Fusion** recognizes that metaverse experiences exist on a spectrum between physical and virtual reality. Designers must carefully consider the appropriate blend of real-world and digital elements to suit the intended purpose of the product. This can range from augmented reality (AR) overlays that enhance physical environments to fully immersive virtual reality (VR) worlds. The key is to seamlessly fuse the physical and digital in a way that feels natural and intuitive to the user.

### 2. Empiricism

**Empiricism** emphasizes the importance of direct experience in designing for the metaverse. It is not enough to speculate about what might work; designers must actively engage with XR technologies and platforms to understand their strengths and limitations. This hands-on approach allows for more informed design decisions and a deeper appreciation of the user's perspective.

### 3. Depth

Metaverse experiences are three-dimensional, and the principle of **Depth** highlights the need to design for this extra dimension. Unlike traditional 2D interfaces, the metaverse allows for experiences that have a sense of scale, distance, and volume. Designers must learn to think in 3D, creating environments and objects that are not only visually appealing but also spatially coherent.

### 4. Attention

The principle of **Attention** addresses the challenge of guiding the user's focus in a 3D environment. With the freedom to look anywhere, it can be easy for users to become disoriented or miss important information. Designers must use a variety of cues – visual, auditory, and haptic – to direct the user's attention and create a clear and compelling narrative.

### 5. Freedom

**Freedom** is a defining characteristic of the metaverse, and this principle encourages designers to embrace it. Users should be able to move and interact with the virtual world in a way that feels natural and unconstrained. This means designing for six degrees of freedom (6DoF) and providing users with a sense of agency and control over their experience.

### 6. Locomotion

**Locomotion** deals with the practicalities of movement in the metaverse. Getting from one place to another in a virtual world can be a challenge, and designers must provide users with a variety of options for navigation. These can range from teleportation and flying to more realistic modes of transport, such as walking or driving. The goal is to make locomotion as seamless and intuitive as possible, so that it does not detract from the overall experience.

### 7. Interaction

The principle of **Interaction** focuses on how users engage with the virtual world and the objects within it. This can involve a wide range of actions, from simple gestures and voice commands to more complex manipulations of virtual objects. Designers must create a system of interaction that is both powerful and easy to learn, allowing users to interact with the metaverse in a way that feels natural and intuitive.

### 8. Presence

**Presence** is the feeling of “being there” in a virtual world. It is a key ingredient of immersive experiences, and designers must strive to create it in their products. This can be achieved through a variety of means, including realistic graphics, spatialized audio, and haptic feedback. The goal is to create a sense of embodiment and to make the user feel as though they are truly present in the virtual environment.

### 9. Permission

The principle of **Permission** addresses the social and ethical considerations of the metaverse. In a shared virtual space, it is important to establish clear rules and boundaries for behavior. Designers must create systems that allow users to control their own experience and to interact with others in a way that is safe and respectful. This includes features such as blocking, muting, and reporting, as well as more proactive measures to prevent harassment and abuse.

### 10. Magic

Finally, the principle of **Magic** encourages designers to embrace the unique possibilities of the metaverse. This is a world where the laws of physics can be bent, where imagination is the only limit. Designers should not be afraid to create experiences that are impossible in the real world, to surprise and delight users with moments of wonder and awe. The metaverse is a new and exciting medium, and it is up to designers to unlock its full potential.

## 1. Overview

The metaverse represents the next evolution of the internet: a 3D-enabled digital space where users can interact with each other and with AI-driven avatars in a persistent, shared, and immersive environment. This emerging digital frontier, powered by a confluence of technologies including virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain, is poised to revolutionize how we work, play, and socialize. As the metaverse matures, it will move beyond its current gaming-centric applications to encompass a wide range of personal and business experiences, from virtual meetings and collaborative workspaces to immersive shopping and entertainment.

At its core, metaverse product design is about creating these experiences. It is a multidisciplinary field that draws on principles from game design, UX/UI design, architecture, and social psychology to build intuitive, engaging, and valuable virtual worlds. Unlike traditional product design, which is often focused on the 2D world of screens and interfaces, metaverse product design must contend with the complexities of 3D space, embodiment, and social interaction. The goal is to create a sense of presence, of “being there,” in the virtual environment, and to empower users with a sense of agency and control over their digital selves.

This pattern, Metaverse Product Design, provides a comprehensive guide to this emerging field. It outlines the core principles that should guide the design of metaverse products, the key practices that are essential for success, and the application contexts in which these products are most likely to thrive. It also provides a practical framework for implementation, a review of the evidence and impact of metaverse products, and a discussion of the cognitive era considerations that will shape the future of this exciting new domain.

## 3. Key Practices

Designing for the metaverse requires a shift in mindset and a new set of practices that are tailored to the unique challenges and opportunities of this immersive medium. The following key practices, drawn from the latest research and industry best practices, provide a practical guide to creating successful metaverse products.

### 1. Design for 3D Navigation

In the metaverse, users navigate in a 3D space, which presents a unique set of challenges. To avoid disorientation and frustration, designers must create intuitive and seamless navigation systems. This can be achieved through the use of visual cues, such as signposts and glowing paths, to guide users through the virtual world. It is also important to implement intuitive controls, such as gestures and VR controllers, that allow for natural and effortless movement.

### 2. Ensure Accessibility

The metaverse should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their physical abilities or the hardware they are using. This means designing cross-platform experiences that work on a variety of devices, from high-end VR headsets to traditional 2D screens. It also means providing alternative navigation methods, such as voice commands and simplified controls, for users with limited mobility.

### 3. Create Intuitive Interactions

Interactions in the metaverse should be as natural and intuitive as they are in the real world. This means designing interactions that mirror real-world behaviors, such as picking up an object with a hand motion. It is also important to provide clear feedback to the user, through haptic feedback and visual cues, to confirm that their actions have been successful.

### 4. Balance Realism and Fantasy

The metaverse is a place where the real and the imaginary can coexist. Designers should not be afraid to embrace the fantastical possibilities of this new medium, while at the same time grounding their experiences in a sense of realism that makes them relatable and believable. The key is to find the right balance between the two, creating experiences that are both magical and immersive.

### 5. Prioritize Personalization

In the metaverse, users want to express their individuality. Designers should provide them with the tools to do so, through extensive avatar customization and personalized environments. This will allow users to create a unique identity for themselves in the virtual world and to feel a sense of ownership over their digital selves.

### 6. Foster Social Interaction

The metaverse is an inherently social platform. Designers must create experiences that facilitate communication and collaboration between users. This includes providing easy-to-use chat and voice tools, as well as clear visual indicators of social presence, such as avatars and name tags.

### 7. Ensure Privacy and Safety

The immersive nature of the metaverse can make users more vulnerable to harassment and abuse. Designers have a responsibility to create safe and inclusive environments for all users. This means implementing robust privacy settings and user controls, as well as moderation tools to prevent abuse in social spaces.

### 8. Provide Clear Onboarding

The metaverse is a new and unfamiliar environment for many users. It is important to provide clear and concise onboarding that teaches them the basics of navigation and interaction. This can be achieved through interactive tutorials that allow users to learn by doing, rather than by reading text-heavy instructions.
## 4. Application Context

Metaverse product design is not a one-size-fits-all endeavor. The principles and practices outlined in this document must be adapted to the specific context in which the product will be used. The following are some of the key application contexts for metaverse product design:

### 1. Gaming and Entertainment

## 5. Implementation

The implementation of a metaverse product is a complex process that requires a combination of creative vision, technical expertise, and a deep understanding of user experience design. The following is a step-by-step guide to the implementation process, from initial concept to final product.

### 1. Conceptualization

The first step in the implementation process is to develop a clear and compelling concept for the metaverse product. This includes defining the purpose of the product, identifying the target audience, and outlining the key features and functionality. It is important to have a clear vision for the product from the outset, as this will guide the entire development process.

### 2. Wireframing

Once the concept has been finalized, the next step is to create a wireframe of the metaverse product. This is a basic blueprint that outlines the structure of the virtual world, the user interface, and the overall user flow. The wireframe should be simple and easy to understand, and it should be used to get feedback from stakeholders before moving on to the more detailed design phase.

### 3. Prototyping

After the wireframe has been approved, the next step is to create a prototype of the metaverse product. This is a preliminary version of the product that allows users to experience the core functionality and to provide feedback on the design. The prototype should be as realistic as possible, and it should be used to test the usability of the product and to identify any potential problems before the final version is built.

### 4. Final Design and Iteration

The final step in the implementation process is to create the final version of the metaverse product. This includes creating the 3D models, textures, and animations, as well as developing the underlying code and infrastructure. The final product should be a polished and professional experience that is ready for public release. It is important to note that the implementation process is not a one-time event. The metaverse is a constantly evolving platform, and it is important to continuously iterate on the product, based on user feedback and new technological developments.

## 6. Evidence & Impact

It is important to address these concerns from the outset, to ensure that the metaverse is a safe and inclusive space for all users. This will require a new set of ethical guidelines for the design and use of AI in the metaverse.

### 8. Commons Alignment Assessment (v2.0)

This assessment evaluates the pattern based on the Commons OS v2.0 framework, which focuses on the pattern's ability to enable resilient collective value creation.

**1. Stakeholder Architecture:**
The pattern focuses heavily on the end-user and their immediate experience, with some consideration for AI as a participant. However, it lacks a broader stakeholder architecture that defines the rights and responsibilities of platform operators, third-party creators, the environment, or future generations. The emphasis is on individual empowerment rather than a holistic, multi-stakeholder system of value creation.

**2. Value Creation Capability:**
The pattern excels at enabling the creation of experiential and social value through immersive and interactive design. It also touches on economic value through e-commerce and new forms of work. However, it does not explicitly address the creation of ecological value or the cultivation of collective resilience as core outcomes of the system.

**3. Resilience & Adaptability:**
By promoting an iterative design process and emphasizing the need to adapt to a constantly evolving technological landscape, the pattern demonstrates a degree of adaptability. However, it does not provide a clear framework for how the system can maintain coherence and thrive on change at a collective level, beyond the adaptability of the product itself.

**4. Ownership Architecture:**
Ownership is primarily framed in terms of personalization and user control over their digital identity, which is a limited view. The pattern does not explore more advanced ownership architectures that define rights and responsibilities beyond individual use, such as collective ownership of the platform or the value generated within it.

**5. Design for Autonomy:**
The pattern is highly aligned with the principle of autonomy, explicitly incorporating the role of AI in content generation, user interaction, and collaboration. Its emphasis on open standards and interoperability also makes it compatible with decentralized systems like DAOs, even if it doesn't prescribe them.

**6. Composability & Interoperability:**
The pattern strongly advocates for cross-platform design and the use of open, interoperable technologies. This inherent focus on interoperability makes it highly composable, allowing it to be combined with other patterns to create larger and more complex value-creation systems in the metaverse.

**7. Fractal Value Creation:**
The core design principles outlined in the pattern can be applied at multiple scales, from individual interactions and objects to entire virtual worlds and platforms. This demonstrates a fractal nature, where the fundamental logic of value creation can be replicated and scaled throughout the system.

**Overall Score: 3 (Transitional)**

**Rationale:**
The pattern provides a strong foundation for designing user-centric and technologically advanced metaverse experiences. It is forward-thinking in its embrace of AI and interoperability. However, it requires significant adaptation to evolve from an individual experience-design framework into a true commons architecture. Its primary gaps are in defining a multi-stakeholder governance model, expanding the definition of value creation, and developing a more sophisticated ownership architecture.

**Opportunities for Improvement:**
- Integrate a multi-stakeholder model that defines the rights and responsibilities of all participants, including users, creators, platform operators, and the environment.
- Expand the scope of value creation to explicitly include ecological and collective resilience goals, not just economic and experiential ones.
- Explore and incorporate principles of collective ownership and governance, such as those found in DAOs or platform cooperatives, to distribute value more equitably.
