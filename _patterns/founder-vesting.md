# TC004: Founder Vesting

### 1. Overview

Founder vesting is a contractual mechanism that governs how the founders of a company earn their ownership equity over a specified period of time. Rather than granting founders their full equity stake upfront, the shares are subject to a vesting schedule, meaning they are earned incrementally as the founder continues to contribute to the company. The core purpose of founder vesting is to align the long-term interests of the founders with the success of the venture, and to protect the company and its stakeholders from the potential disruption caused by a founder's premature departure. By making equity ownership contingent on continued service, vesting incentivizes founders to remain committed to the company's growth and development over the long haul.

The primary problem that founder vesting solves is the "leaver" problem, where a co-founder leaves the company in its early stages but retains a significant portion of the equity. This can create a situation where a departed founder holds a large block of shares without contributing to the company's future success, a scenario often referred to as "dead equity." This can be demoralizing for the remaining founders and can be a major red flag for potential investors, who want to see that the equity is in the hands of those who are actively building the company. The concept of founder vesting was popularized in the venture capital and startup communities, particularly in Silicon Valley, as a way to mitigate this risk and ensure that equity is tied to ongoing contributions.

From a commons-aligned perspective, founder vesting can be seen as a mechanism for ensuring that the value created by the collective efforts of the founding team is distributed fairly and equitably. It helps to prevent a situation where one individual can extract a disproportionate amount of value without a corresponding long-term commitment to the project. By tying equity to continued participation, vesting reinforces the principle that ownership should be earned through sustained contribution to the commons. This aligns with the idea of stewardship, where founders are seen as custodians of the company's mission and resources, rather than simply as owners of a financial asset.

### 2. Core Principles

1.  **Equity is Earned, Not Given:** The fundamental principle behind founder vesting is that ownership should be a reward for sustained effort and contribution over time, not a one-time grant at the inception of the company.
2.  **Long-Term Alignment:** Vesting schedules are designed to align the financial interests of the founders with the long-term success of the company, encouraging them to stay and build value over a period of several years.
3.  **Protection Against Early Departure:** Vesting protects the company, its co-founders, and its investors from the negative consequences of a founder leaving prematurely, ensuring that a significant portion of the equity remains with those who are actively contributing.
4.  **Fairness and Equity:** Vesting promotes a sense of fairness among co-founders by ensuring that everyone's ownership stake is proportional to their ongoing commitment and contribution to the venture.
5.  **Investor Confidence:** The presence of a founder vesting agreement is a strong signal to investors that the founding team is committed and that the company has a mechanism for dealing with potential founder departures.
6.  **Flexibility and Adaptability:** Vesting agreements can be structured in various ways to accommodate the specific circumstances of the company and its founders, including provisions for acceleration and different types of leaver scenarios.

### 3. Key Practices

1.  **Standard Vesting Schedule:** The most common vesting schedule is a four-year period with a one-year "cliff." This means that no shares vest for the first year, and then 25% of the shares vest on the first anniversary of the founder's start date. The remaining shares then vest in equal monthly or quarterly installments over the next three years.
2.  **The One-Year Cliff:** The one-year cliff is a critical component of the vesting schedule. It serves as a probationary period, ensuring that a founder who leaves within the first year does not walk away with any equity.
3.  **Acceleration Clauses:** Vesting agreements often include acceleration clauses that provide for the acceleration of vesting in certain circumstances, such as a change of control (i.e., the sale of the company). A "single-trigger" acceleration clause is triggered by the sale of the company, while a "double-trigger" acceleration clause requires both a sale of the company and the termination of the founder's employment without cause.
4.  **Good Leaver vs. Bad Leaver Provisions:** These provisions define what happens to a founder's vested and unvested shares if they leave the company. A "good leaver" (e.g., someone who leaves due to death or disability) may be treated more favorably than a "bad leaver" (e.g., someone who is terminated for cause).
5.  **Repurchase Rights:** The company typically has the right to repurchase a departing founder's unvested shares at a predetermined price, which is often the lower of the original purchase price or the fair market value at the time of departure.
6.  **83(b) Election:** In the United States, founders who receive stock that is subject to vesting should consider making an 83(b) election with the IRS. This election allows the founder to pay taxes on the entire value of the stock at the time it is granted, rather than as it vests, which can result in significant tax savings if the value of the stock increases over time.
7.  **Founder Agreements:** All of these terms should be clearly documented in a formal founder vesting agreement that is signed by all of the co-founders.

### 4. Implementation

Implementing founder vesting is a critical step in the formation of any new venture with multiple co-founders. The first step is for the founders to have an open and honest conversation about their expectations, roles, and long-term commitment to the company. This conversation should cover the key terms of the vesting agreement, including the length of the vesting period, the presence of a cliff, and the terms of any acceleration or leaver provisions. It is highly recommended that the founders seek legal counsel to help them draft a formal founder vesting agreement that accurately reflects their understanding and complies with all applicable laws and regulations.

Once the terms of the vesting agreement have been agreed upon, they should be formally documented in a legally binding contract. This agreement should be signed by all of the co-founders and should be kept in a safe and accessible place. It is also important to ensure that the company's bylaws and other corporate documents are consistent with the terms of the founder vesting agreement. For example, the company's stock plan should include provisions that allow for the repurchase of unvested shares from departing founders.

A real-world example of founder vesting in action is the case of a tech startup with three co-founders. They agree to a standard four-year vesting schedule with a one-year cliff. After six months, one of the co-founders decides to leave the company to pursue another opportunity. Because the one-year cliff has not yet been met, the departing co-founder does not receive any equity in the company. The company then repurchases the departing co-founder's unvested shares, which can then be used to incentivize a new team member. This example illustrates how founder vesting can protect the company and its remaining founders from the potentially damaging effects of an early founder departure.

| Pillar       | Score (1-5) | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose      | 4           | Founder vesting strongly aligns with the purpose of building a sustainable and resilient venture by ensuring that the founding team is committed for the long term.                                                                                                                                  |
| Governance   | 4           | Vesting agreements are a key component of good corporate governance, providing a clear and transparent framework for managing founder equity and departures.                                                                                                                                        |
| Culture      | 3           | While vesting can create a culture of accountability and commitment, it can also be a source of tension and conflict if not handled carefully.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Incentives   | 5           | Vesting is a powerful incentive mechanism that directly ties a founder's financial rewards to their long-term contribution to the company's success.                                                                                                                                             |
| Knowledge    | 3           | The implementation of founder vesting requires a certain level of legal and financial knowledge, which may not be readily available to all founders.                                                                                                                                                |
| Technology   | N/A         | Technology is not a significant factor in the implementation of founder vesting, which is primarily a legal and contractual mechanism.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Resilience   | 5           | Founder vesting significantly enhances the resilience of a venture by mitigating the risks associated with founder departures and ensuring that the company can continue to operate and thrive even if one of the founders leaves.                                                                 |
| **Overall**  | **4.0**     | **Founder vesting is a highly effective pattern for aligning the interests of founders with the long-term success of a venture. It is a critical tool for building a resilient and sustainable company, and it is particularly well-suited to commons-aligned ventures that are focused on creating long-term value for a broad community of stakeholders.** |

### 6. When to Use

*   When starting a new venture with multiple co-founders.
*   When seeking investment from venture capitalists or other institutional investors.
*   When you want to create a strong incentive for founders to remain committed to the company for the long term.
*   When you want to protect the company from the risks associated with a founder's premature departure.
*   When you want to ensure that equity is distributed fairly and equitably among the founding team.
*   When you are building a commons-aligned venture and want to ensure that the value created by the community is not disproportionately captured by a small number of individuals.

### 7. Anti-Patterns and Gotchas

*   **Not having a vesting agreement at all:** This is the most common and most dangerous mistake. Without a vesting agreement, a departing founder can walk away with a significant portion of the company's equity, even if they have only been with the company for a short period of time.
*   **Unclear or ambiguous terms:** The terms of the vesting agreement should be clear, concise, and unambiguous. Any ambiguity can lead to disputes and litigation down the road.
*   **Failing to consider the tax implications:** The 83(b) election is a critical but often overlooked aspect of founder vesting. Failing to make this election can result in a significant tax liability for founders.
*   **Not seeking legal advice:** Founder vesting agreements are complex legal documents. It is essential to seek legal advice from an experienced attorney to ensure that the agreement is properly drafted and complies with all applicable laws and regulations.
*   **One-size-fits-all approach:** Every company is different, and the terms of the vesting agreement should be tailored to the specific circumstances of the company and its founders.
*   **Ignoring the human element:** Founder vesting can be a sensitive topic. It is important to have open and honest conversations with your co-founders to ensure that everyone is on the same page and feels that they are being treated fairly.
