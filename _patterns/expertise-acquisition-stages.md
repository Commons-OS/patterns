### Section 1: Context

Commons stewarding systems face a paradox: they require people with genuine expertise to make adaptive decisions in complexity, yet they often invest training resources uniformly across all skill levels. A growing activist network organizing housing justice faces this acutely—field organizers need rule-following capacity to execute voter contact scripts, but strategy leads need intuitive pattern recognition to spot when a campaign strategy is weakening. Similarly, a tech cooperative expanding its product engineering relies on onboarding procedures for junior developers, but its architecture decisions atrophy if senior engineers never move beyond implementing established patterns. Government training programs show the same fracture: front-line caseworkers need procedural fluency to navigate policy correctly, but policy designers need to develop the cognitive flexibility to sense when regulations are creating perverse incentives. The ecosystem is fragmenting not because people lack potential, but because the *cognitive demands shift radically* as expertise grows, and most organizations treat development as a linear ramp rather than a series of qualitative transformations.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Expertise vs. Stages.**

Organizations pull in two directions. The Expertise impulse wants to fast-track people to expert-level judgment—to make them valuable contributors quickly, to solve complex problems faster. The Stages impulse recognizes that cognitive maturation cannot be compressed; expertise requires movement through distinct phases of learning, each with its own logic and failure modes.

The tension breaks systems in predictable ways. When Expertise dominates (skipping stages), novices receive "advanced" training in pattern recognition and intuition when they haven't yet built the foundational procedural knowledge—they become dangerous, making creative mistakes in contexts requiring reliability. When Stages dominates (rigid gatekeeping), people plateau at competence; they execute procedures flawlessly but never develop the perceptual shift that lets them sense violations and exceptions. A housing justice organizer perfectly executing voter scripts but unable to read a room's power dynamics. An engineer implementing architectural decisions they don't understand, unable to adapt when conditions shift.

The real cost is vitality drain: the organization loses both reliability (novices who lack foundations) and adaptive capacity (competent people who never develop intuitive judgment). Worse, it misdiagnoses the problem—blaming individual capability rather than recognizing that the organization is asking the wrong cognitive task at the wrong stage.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, design development pathways that explicitly name the cognitive transformation required at each stage and customize learning methods to match each stage's specific demand.**

This pattern treats expertise acquisition as a *passage through qualitatively different ways of knowing*, not as accumulation along a single axis. The Dreyfus Model identifies five stages—each requiring a different relationship between the learner and the domain.

At the **Novice stage**, the learner follows context-free rules ("if voter says X, respond with Y"; "for loop iterates N times"). The cognitive work is *rule storage and execution*. Training here must be procedural, explicit, and repetitive. The system succeeds when the novice can reliably follow instructions in predictable conditions.

At the **Advanced Beginner stage**, real-world variation appears. The novice has enough procedural knowledge to encounter exceptions ("what if the voter gets angry?"). Training shifts: introduce *situated examples* and pattern spotting within constrained domains. The learner begins recognizing that context matters, but still relies on rules modified by observable features.

At the **Competency stage**, the learner has internalized enough patterns to choose between competing strategies. They no longer need exhaustive rules; they have acquired *deliberate judgment*. Training shifts again: learners need complex, ambiguous scenarios requiring trade-off reasoning. Failure is productive here—it builds discernment.

At the **Proficiency stage**, patterns have become *perceptual*. The expert sees a housing market and immediately senses instability; reads a room and knows when leverage has shifted. They don't consciously calculate—they recognize wholes. Training here becomes mentorship and exposure to edge cases; the goal is expanding their intuitive library.

At **Mastery**, the practitioner can teach; they've integrated the domain so deeply they can articulate the *why* beneath the patterns others follow unconsciously.

This staging prevents two decay modes. One: treating everyone as novices and overwhelming them with premature complexity. Two: treating everyone as experts and wondering why competent people never develop adaptive capacity. The pattern holds the system in vitality by matching *cognitive demand to cognitive stage*.

### Section 4: Implementation

**Map your current population by stage.** Before designing any learning intervention, audit who is where. Not through credential alone—through observation. In a corporate training context, interview a mix of people doing the same role; ask them to narrate a recent decision. Listen for rule-following language ("I followed the process because...") vs. pattern recognition ("I sensed the customer was really saying..."). In government casework, observe how people handle policy exceptions: novices ask supervisors; competent staff modify approach based on client context; proficient staff intuit which policies are being applied backwards. Document this map. It's your fertility gauge.

**For Novices, build procedural clarity and safe repetition.** In tech onboarding, this means explicit documentation of how to deploy code, how the build system works, why each step matters. Run structured pair programming where the novice follows while the guide narrates the procedure. Create low-stakes sandbox environments where mistakes carry no real cost. In activist training, this is the voter contact script, the door-knock sequence, the script for handling a hostile response. Repetition here is not punishment; it's how neural pathways solidify. Measure success by procedural fluency, not judgment.

**For Advanced Beginners, introduce situated examples and boundary cases.** In corporate settings, move from "here's the sales process" to "here are five real deals; walk us through each one." In government, present variants of the same policy situation and ask: what changes your approach? In tech, code reviews shift from "did you follow the style guide?" to "walk us through your reasoning for this architecture choice." In activism, move from scripts to role-plays with curve-ball scenarios: voter challenges the organization's position; community member reveals deep mistrust. The training here is *noticing what matters*—not yet deciding, but perception-building.

**For Competent practitioners, create decision-dense environments and require articulated trade-offs.** Corporate: high-stakes projects where they choose between competing strategies and must defend their choice. Government: policy design tasks where they propose modifications to address unintended consequences. Tech: architecture reviews where they propose solutions to scaling challenges. Activist: campaign strategy sessions where they map power, identify leverage points, and choose between direct action and negotiation paths. Measure success by the *quality of reasoning*, not the outcome. A well-reasoned decision that fails teaches more than a lucky success.

**For Proficient and Master practitioners, shift to apprenticeship and institutional learning.** Pair them with newer learners intentionally. Create forums where they articulate their intuitions—not to codify them into rules, but to expand the intuitive library of others through exposure. In tech, this is architecture reviews where they explain not just decisions but the perceptual shifts that made the decision obvious. In activism, this is strategy reflection sessions where seasoned organizers narrate how they read a room's readiness. In government, this is policy retrospectives where experienced designers explain which design choices they'd change and why.

**Protect against stage collapse.** The most common failure is treating everyone above "novice" as interchangeable. A competent housing organizer is not a proficient strategist. Design accountability accordingly—don't ask a competent practitioner to exercise mastery-level judgment; give them complex decisions within bounded domains. Don't ask a novice to make judgment calls; give them clear procedures in low-stakes contexts.

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

This pattern grows genuine adaptive capacity. When novices genuinely master procedures, they develop the cognitive foundation that later allows pattern recognition. Organizations move away from brittle expertise (one person who knows everything) toward distributed understanding at appropriate stages. A tech cooperative with explicit stage awareness develops junior engineers who eventually contribute architecture thinking, rather than permanent junior engineers executing others' decisions. Housing justice networks generate strategy leaders from field organizers because they deliberately cultivate the progression. The system becomes antifragile: it has deep procedural reliability (strong novice foundation) and genuine adaptive capacity (people moving through stages).

Relationships deepen. Mentorship becomes real when both mentor and learner understand what cognitive work is actually happening. A proficient activist can explain to a competent organizer why they're making a seemingly counterintuitive strategic choice—not from authority, but from shared language about how judgment evolves.

**What risks emerge:**

The pattern can calcify into gatekeeping. Organizations begin treating stages as fixed identity ("she's a competent level—she'll never be strategy-ready"), blocking people's passage. This often happens when proficient practitioners feel threatened by emerging expertise and slow advancement deliberately. Watch for this in corporate hierarchies and government bureaucracies especially.

Resilience is moderately vulnerable (3.0 score). The pattern depends on continuous investment in each stage—it's maintenance-intensive. If organizations face resource pressure, they often gut training at lower stages to preserve expert development, creating a bottleneck of underdeveloped novices who never progress. The fractal value (4.0) suggests that this pattern scales, but each iteration requires intentional cultivation; it won't self-replicate.

The pattern also risks becoming a taxonomy that replaces genuine understanding. Organizations document their "5-stage model" and check boxes without asking whether their training actually *moves* people through stages. Auditing this requires direct observation, not document review—more expensive than compliance theater.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**NASA Mission Control, 1960s–present:** NASA's flight director training explicitly uses stage progression. New flight directors begin with procedure mastery—they learn every checklist, every contingency response. They work in simulation, executing known problems repeatedly until procedures become automatic. Over months, they advance to real-time problem-solving in lower-stakes missions, learning to recognize when standard procedures won't work. By the time they're directing Apollo or Space Shuttle operations, they've developed the intuitive pattern recognition that lets them sense catastrophic failure from subtle instrument readings. Flight directors like Gene Kranz famously developed judgment that couldn't be taught through procedure alone—it emerged through deliberate passage through stages. When NASA has tried to shortcut this (promoting capable proceduralists directly to flight director), failures have followed.

**Occupational safety in construction unions:** Union apprenticeship programs in ironworking explicitly separate stages. First-year apprentices learn safety rules and tool handling through repetition on controlled sites. Year two adds complexity—working at heights, learning to read load-bearing. By year three, experienced apprentices work on complex projects and develop the perceptual awareness that lets them spot a poorly rigged load before it fails. Master ironworkers can teach because they've integrated the domain so completely they can articulate the *why* beneath the rules. Contrast this with non-union sites where safety is treated as a checkbox—workers never develop the stage-based competence that builds intuitive safety judgment.

**Community organizing in Southern civil rights movements:** Ella Baker's training of young organizers deliberately used stage progression. New organizers began with specific tasks—phone banking, voter registration, logistics. They weren't thrown into strategic meetings; they built the procedural foundation first. As they demonstrated situational judgment, they moved into campaign planning. Veteran organizers like John Lewis and Bob Moses became mentors not because they were promoted up a hierarchy, but because they'd genuinely moved through stages of cognitive development and could now articulate judgment to others. Baker explicitly resisted rapid advancement that skipped stages, understanding that genuine strategic thinking emerges only through accumulated pattern recognition in real organizing contexts.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

AI and distributed intelligence reshape this pattern in three critical ways.

**First, procedural automation inverts the novice stage.** What once required months of repetitive rule-following—the grounding work that built cognitive foundations—can now be offloaded to systems. A novice tax accountant no longer needs to memorize filing procedures; the AI handles it. This seems efficient but risks creating a population of "competent-appearing" practitioners who never developed the procedural literacy that lets them recognize when the system is giving wrong answers. The danger isn't that novices skip the procedural stage; it's that they lose the *cognitive foundation* that stage built. A housing justice organizer who never door-knocked, never felt a room shift, never learned voters' actual concerns, will miss the patterns that data-driven models miss. Implementation strategy: use AI to accelerate procedural tasks, but *preserve the learning element*. The novice should understand why the procedure works, not just use the tool.

**Second, AI enables new kinds of expert training at scale.** Proficient practitioners can now encode their perceptual patterns in ways that weren't possible before. A seasoned epidemiologist can work with AI systems to externalize how she reads early outbreak signals; this becomes teachable to advanced beginners who would previously have needed years of mentorship. This accelerates passage through stages—but only if the training preserves the *reasoning*, not just the outputs. Implementation: use AI to make proficient practitioners' judgment more visible and transferable, but don't skip the intermediate stages of understanding.

**Third, the pattern must account for AI-native stages that have no historical precedent.** A software engineer now must develop judgment about when to trust AI-generated code, when to reject it, when to modify it—a cognitive task with no analog in traditional expertise acquisition. The Dreyfus Model assumes movement through stages in a relatively stable domain. In domains where AI is rapidly reshaping what "expert" means, the stages themselves may shift. Implementation: explicitly surface these new judgment demands in your training. Don't treat them as advanced features for experts only; make them visible to competent practitioners developing toward proficiency.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

Observable progression: You can name three people who have moved from novice to advanced beginner to competent in the last 18 months. Not because policy requires it, but because the system created conditions for passage. Ask them to narrate their own cognitive shift—do they articulate it? ("I used to need the script; now I can read the room.") Do leaders actually mentor differently at different stages, or do they use the same language with everyone?

Stagewise hiring and onboarding: When you interview candidates, you're not asking "can you do the job at expert level?" but rather "what stage are you in, and what's your growth trajectory?" When you onboard, you don't treat everyone identically. New hires in novice roles receive procedure and repetition; new hires in competent roles receive ambiguity and decision density. Does your onboarding change based on stage, or is it copy-pasted?

Language shifts at the table: In meetings, do people reference the cognitive work of their stage? Novices ask "what's the procedure?"; competent practitioners debate "which approach is better given these constraints?"; proficient practitioners articulate "I sense something is shifting; here's why." If everyone is using the same language regardless of role, the pattern has hollowed.

**Signs of decay:**

Stage collapse: The organization treats all non-novices as interchangeable. Everyone above entry level gets the same training, same expectations, same accountability. Competent people are asked to exercise mastery-level judgment; proficient people are underutilized. Watch for: "She's ready for that decision" when she's actually competent, not proficient, in that domain.

Procedural rot: Novices no longer develop procedural fluency; instead, they're rushed to "decision-making" roles because the organization believes procedure is boring or inefficient. Years later, these people fail under pressure because they don't have the automated foundation that frees cognitive capacity for judgment. They're fragile, not adaptive.

Mentorship disappearing: Proficient and master practitioners stop articulating their reasoning. They become isolated decision-makers rather than teachers. The stage-based progression stalls because there's no apprenticeship. Watch for: "I can't really explain why; it just felt right" when articulation is actually possible, just underdeveloped.

**When to replant:**

Replant this pattern when you realize you have competent people who've plateaued—people doing good work within their scope but showing no signs of developing intuitive judgment. This signals the system isn't actively cultivating passage through stages; it's warehousing competence. Redesign mentorship and decision-making structures to create genuine apprenticeship conditions.

Replant when new technology or external shifts create entirely new domains (AI integration, policy changes, market restructuring). The stages themselves remain valid, but the *content* of each stage needs regrounding. Your flight directors may be proficient at traditional systems but novices at AI-integrated ones.
