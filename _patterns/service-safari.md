# Service Safari

## 1. Overview

A service safari is a qualitative research method where individuals experience a service firsthand to understand it from a customer's perspective. It involves immersing oneself in the service environment to observe, interact, and document the entire customer journey. This direct experience allows for the identification of strengths, weaknesses, pain points, and opportunities for improvement that might not be apparent through other research methods. By 'walking in the customer's shoes,' researchers and design teams can build empathy and gain deep insights into the real-world context of the service. The term itself, "safari," evokes a sense of exploration and discovery, which is at the heart of this method. It is about venturing into the "wild" of the service ecosystem to observe and learn.

The origins of the service safari are rooted in ethnographic research and contextual inquiry, methods that emphasize the importance of studying people in their natural environments. It is also related to the practice of "mystery shopping," where individuals pose as customers to evaluate the quality of a service. However, a service safari is more than just an evaluation; it is a deep, immersive experience that aims to generate rich, qualitative insights. It is a form of "auto-ethnography," where the researcher is also the subject of the research.

## 2. Core Principles

The practice of a service safari is guided by a set of core principles that ensure its effectiveness as a research method. These principles are:

- **Empathy:** The primary goal of a service safari is to build empathy for the customer by experiencing the service as they do. This means not just observing the service from a distance, but actively participating in it and paying attention to the emotions, feelings, and perceptions that arise. Empathy is the foundation of human-centered design, and the service safari is a powerful tool for cultivating it.

- **Holistic View:** A service safari encourages a holistic understanding of the service, looking at the entire customer journey across all touchpoints, rather than focusing on individual components in isolation. This is crucial because the customer experience is shaped by the sum of all interactions with the service, from the first point of contact to the last. A holistic view helps to identify the "seams" between different touchpoints and to understand how they work together (or not) to create a cohesive experience.

- **Direct Experience:** The method is experiential, relying on direct observation and interaction with the service in its natural context. This is in contrast to other research methods, such as surveys and interviews, which rely on self-reported data. Direct experience provides a much richer and more nuanced understanding of the service, as it allows the researcher to observe the subtle cues and behaviors that people may not be able to articulate.

- **Qualitative Insight:** A service safari generates rich qualitative data, including emotions, feelings, and perceptions, which are crucial for understanding the customer experience. This type of data is often more valuable than quantitative data for identifying the "why" behind customer behavior. It can reveal the unmet needs, frustrations, and desires that can inspire innovation and drive service improvements.

- **Contextual Understanding:** A service safari provides a deep understanding of the context in which the service is used, including the physical environment, social interactions, and cultural factors. This is important because the context has a profound impact on the customer experience. For example, the experience of using a mobile banking app is very different when you are on a crowded bus versus when you are in the comfort of your own home. A service safari allows the researcher to experience these contextual factors firsthand.

## 3. Key Practices

To conduct a successful service safari, it is important to follow a set of key practices. These practices are:

- **Immersion:** Fully immersing oneself in the customer role, including adopting the mindset and behaviors of a typical user. This means trying to forget that you are a researcher and to experience the service as a real customer would. It may even involve creating a persona and a scenario to guide your experience.

- **Observation:** Paying close attention to all aspects of the service environment, including physical artifacts, digital interfaces, and interactions with staff and other customers. This requires a keen eye for detail and the ability to notice the small things that can make a big difference to the customer experience. It is also important to be aware of your own biases and to try to observe the service as objectively as possible.

- **Documentation:** Recording observations through notes, photos, videos, and audio recordings to capture the experience in detail. This is crucial for preserving the insights and for sharing them with others. The choice of documentation method will depend on the context of the service and the preferences of the researcher. However, it is important to capture not just what you see and hear, but also what you feel and think.

- **Reflection:** Analyzing and reflecting on the experience to identify key insights, pain points, and opportunities for improvement. This is where the real value of the service safari is generated. It is important to set aside time after the safari to review your notes and to think deeply about what you have learned. This can be done individually or as a group.

- **Journey Mapping:** Creating customer journey maps to visualize the customer's experience and identify key touchpoints and moments of truth. A journey map is a powerful tool for communicating the findings of a service safari and for identifying areas for improvement. It can help to bring the customer experience to life and to create a shared understanding of the service among all stakeholders.

## 4. Application Context

A service safari can be applied in a wide range of contexts, from improving existing services to designing new ones. Some of the most common application contexts are:

- **Service Improvement:** To identify areas for improvement in an existing service. By experiencing the service firsthand, researchers can identify the pain points and frustrations that customers are experiencing and can come up with ideas for how to address them. For example, a service safari of a hospital emergency room could reveal opportunities for improving the waiting experience and for providing better communication to patients and their families.

- **Competitor Analysis:** To understand the customer experience of a competitor's service. This can be a valuable way to benchmark your own service and to identify best practices that you can adopt. For example, a service safari of a competitor's e-commerce website could reveal insights into their checkout process, their customer support, and their overall user experience.

- **New Service Design:** To inform the design of a new service by understanding the context and user needs. A service safari can be a powerful tool for generating insights that can inspire new service concepts. For example, a service safari of a public transportation system could reveal the unmet needs of commuters and could lead to the development of a new mobile app for real-time tracking of buses and trains.

- **Employee Training:** To help employees understand the customer experience and identify ways to improve their service delivery. By having employees go on a service safari, you can help them to see the service from the customer's perspective and to develop a deeper appreciation for the importance of their role. This can be a powerful way to foster a culture of customer-centricity within an organization.

## 5. Implementation

Implementing a service safari involves a series of steps, from planning to analysis and sharing of results. The following is a step-by-step guide to implementing a service safari:

1.  **Define the Scope:** The first step is to clearly define the service and the specific customer journey to be explored. This will help to focus the research and to ensure that you are collecting the right data. It is also important to define the goals of the safari and what you hope to learn from it.

2.  **Prepare for the Safari:** This includes setting a clear goal, choosing the participants, and deciding what to bring (e.g., notebook, camera). It is also important to create a plan for the safari, including a timeline and a list of the touchpoints to be observed. If you are conducting the safari as a group, it is important to assign roles and responsibilities to each participant.

3.  **Conduct the Safari:** Immerse yourself in the service, follow the customer journey, and document your observations. It is important to be present in the moment and to pay attention to all the details of the experience. It is also important to be flexible and to be prepared to deviate from your plan if necessary.

4.  **Analyze the Findings:** After the safari, analyze the collected data to identify key insights, pain points, and opportunities. This can be done by reviewing your notes, photos, and videos, and by looking for patterns and themes. It can also be helpful to create a customer journey map to visualize the experience.

5.  **Share the Results:** The final step is to share the findings with the relevant stakeholders to drive action and improvements. This can be done through a presentation, a report, or a workshop. It is important to tell a compelling story that brings the customer experience to life and that inspires people to take action.

## 6. Evidence & Impact

The service safari method has been shown to be a powerful tool for driving service improvements and innovation. There are numerous case studies that demonstrate the impact of service safaris on service design and business outcomes. For example, a multi-city public transportation safari conducted by Harmonic Design revealed key insights into user needs and preferences, leading to recommendations for improving communication, waiting areas, and navigation [3]. In another case, a service safari at a public library helped to identify opportunities for improving the process of obtaining a library card and checking out books [3].

These examples demonstrate the ability of service safaris to provide actionable insights that can lead to tangible improvements in the customer experience. The impact of a service safari can be seen in a number of ways, including:

-   **Improved Customer Satisfaction:** By identifying and addressing the pain points in the customer journey, service safaris can lead to a significant improvement in customer satisfaction.
-   **Increased Customer Loyalty:** A better customer experience can lead to increased customer loyalty and retention.
-   **Enhanced Brand Reputation:** A positive customer experience can enhance the reputation of a brand and can help to differentiate it from its competitors.
-   **Increased Revenue:** By improving the customer experience, service safaris can lead to increased revenue and profitability.

## 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

In the Cognitive Era, where artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive computing are increasingly prevalent, the service safari method can be enhanced and adapted. The Cognitive Era is characterized by the increasing ability of machines to perform tasks that have traditionally required human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing images, and making complex decisions [4]. This has profound implications for service design and for the practice of service safaris.

AI-powered tools can be used to analyze the vast amounts of data collected during a safari, uncovering patterns and insights that might not be apparent to human observers. For example, natural language processing can be used to analyze customer reviews and social media comments to identify common themes and sentiments. Computer vision can be used to analyze photos and videos to identify patterns in customer behavior. And machine learning can be used to build predictive models that can anticipate customer needs and preferences.

Furthermore, service safaris can be used to understand the customer experience of AI-powered services, helping to ensure that these services are designed in a human-centered way. As AI becomes more integrated into our daily lives, it is crucial that we design these services in a way that is transparent, fair, and accountable. A service safari can be a valuable tool for identifying the potential ethical and social implications of AI-powered services and for ensuring that they are designed in a way that benefits all of humanity.

The cognitive era presents both new opportunities and new challenges for service design, and the service safari remains a valuable tool for navigating this evolving landscape. By combining the human-centered approach of the service safari with the analytical power of AI, we can create services that are not only more efficient and effective, but also more human and more humane.

### 8. Commons Alignment Assessment (v2.0)

This assessment evaluates the pattern based on the Commons OS v2.0 framework, which focuses on the pattern's ability to enable resilient collective value creation.

**1. Stakeholder Architecture:**
The Service Safari pattern is primarily focused on understanding the customer as a key stakeholder. It defines a process for researchers or designers to step into the customer's shoes, thereby centering their Rights (to a good experience) and uncovering the Responsibilities (of the service provider). However, it does not inherently define a broader stakeholder architecture that includes employees, partners, the environment, or future generations, which is a key aspect of a commons.

**2. Value Creation Capability:**
The pattern directly enables the creation of knowledge and empathy value by generating deep, qualitative insights into the customer experience. This, in turn, can lead to the creation of social value (improved services for the community) and economic value (increased business success). Its focus is on understanding value from a user-centric perspective, which is a foundational element for any collective value creation system.

**3. Resilience & Adaptability:**
Service Safari is a powerful tool for enhancing system resilience and adaptability. By systematically identifying service pain points and opportunities for improvement, it allows organizations to adapt their offerings to meet changing user needs and environmental conditions. This iterative process of feedback and improvement helps the service maintain coherence and thrive on complexity.

**4. Ownership Architecture:**
The pattern does not directly address ownership architecture. It is a research method focused on experience and empathy, not on the distribution of rights and responsibilities that define ownership in a commons. The insights gained could inform a more equitable ownership design, but this is not an explicit part of the pattern itself.

**5. Design for Autonomy:**
While a human-driven process, Service Safari is highly compatible with designing for autonomy. The deep contextual understanding it generates is critical for designing AI and distributed systems that are genuinely user-centered and effective. It helps mitigate the risk of creating autonomous systems that are disconnected from real-world human needs, though the process itself requires significant human coordination.

**6. Composability & Interoperability:**
This pattern is exceptionally composable. It serves as a discovery and empathy-building module that can be combined with a wide array of other patterns for service design, business model generation, and technology development. The insights from a Service Safari provide the necessary context and user-centric data for other patterns to be applied effectively, making it a valuable component in a larger value-creation system.

**7. Fractal Value Creation:**
The core logic of the Service Safari—gaining empathetic, first-hand experience of a system—is highly fractal. It can be applied at various scales, from a micro-interaction within a single application to the experience of a multinational service, or even the process of engaging with a public institution. This scalability allows the value-creation logic of deep user understanding to be replicated across different levels of a complex system.

**Overall Score: 3 (Transitional)**

**Rationale:**
Service Safari is a powerful enabler of user-centric value creation and a critical input for designing resilient systems. However, it is rated as Transitional because it is not a complete value creation architecture in itself. Its primary focus is on a single stakeholder (the customer), and it requires integration with other patterns to address the full stakeholder ecosystem, ownership, and governance aspects of a true commons.

**Opportunities for Improvement:**
- Develop a "Multi-Stakeholder Safari" variant that explicitly includes experiencing the service from the perspective of employees, partners, and community members.
- Combine the insights from the safari with patterns like "Benefit-Sharing Agreements" to ensure the value created is distributed equitably among all stakeholders.
- Use the safari as a starting point for a "Commons-Based Service Design" process that explicitly aims to create social and ecological value alongside economic value.
