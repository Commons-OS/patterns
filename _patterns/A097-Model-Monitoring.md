_# Pattern: Model Monitoring

## 1. Pattern Name and Number

**A097: Model Monitoring**

## 2. Problem

An AI model that performs well in the lab can fail silently in production. The statistical properties of real-world data can change over time (a phenomenon known as "data drift" or "concept drift"), causing the model's performance to degrade. The model may also start making biased or unfair predictions, or it could be the target of adversarial attacks. Without continuous monitoring, these problems can go undetected, leading to poor business outcomes, reputational damage, and a loss of user trust.

## 3. Context

You have deployed an AI model into a production environment. You need to ensure that the model continues to perform as expected over time and that any issues are detected and addressed quickly.

## 4. Solution

**Implement a comprehensive Model Monitoring solution that continuously tracks the performance, stability, and fairness of your production AI models.**

This involves monitoring several key aspects of the model:
1.  **Data Drift**: Tracking the statistical distribution of the input data and alerting when it drifts significantly from the distribution of the training data.
2.  **Prediction Drift**: Tracking the statistical distribution of the model's predictions.
3.  **Model Performance**: Tracking key performance metrics (like accuracy, precision, recall) by comparing the model's predictions to ground truth data (when available).
4.  **Fairness and Bias**: Monitoring the model's predictions across different demographic groups to detect and mitigate bias.
5.  **Outliers and Anomalies**: Identifying unusual or unexpected inputs that could indicate data quality issues or adversarial attacks.

This requires a specialized monitoring platform that can ingest model inputs and outputs, perform statistical analysis, and provide dashboards and alerts.

## 5. Rationale

Model monitoring is the equivalent of application performance monitoring (APM) for the AI era. It:
- **Ensures Model Reliability**: Provides early warning of performance degradation, allowing you to retrain or update the model before it impacts the business.
- **Manages AI Risk**: Helps to detect and mitigate risks related to bias, fairness, and security.
- **Provides Operational Visibility**: Gives you a clear understanding of how your models are behaving in the real world.
- **Closes the Loop**: Provides the feedback necessary to drive a continuous cycle of model improvement (MLOps).

## 6. Consequences

- **Positive**:
    - Increased trust and confidence in your production AI systems.
    - Faster detection and resolution of model-related issues.
    - A more robust and reliable AI infrastructure.
- **Negative**:
    - **Requires specialized tooling**: Traditional monitoring tools are not sufficient for monitoring AI models.
    - **Can be complex to set up**: Requires a data pipeline to capture model inputs and outputs and a platform to perform the analysis.
    - **Ground truth can be delayed**: For many models, the ground truth data needed to calculate performance metrics is not available immediately, which makes real-time performance monitoring difficult.

## 7. Known Uses

- **All major technology companies** with significant AI deployments have sophisticated internal model monitoring platforms.
- **ML Monitoring Platforms**: A growing market of commercial and open-source tools (e.g., WhyLabs, Fiddler, Arize, Evidently AI) has emerged to provide model monitoring as a service.
