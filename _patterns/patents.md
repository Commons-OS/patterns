# Patents

### 1. Overview

A patent is a form of intellectual property that grants its owner the legal right to exclude others from making, using, selling, and importing an invention for a limited period of years, in exchange for public disclosure of the invention. The core purpose of the patent system is to encourage innovation by providing inventors with a temporary monopoly, allowing them to recoup their research and development costs and profit from their work. This system is designed to solve the problem of underinvestment in innovation that might occur if competitors could freely copy new inventions without bearing the costs of their development. The origins of the modern patent system can be traced back to the Venetian Patent Statute of 1474. The United States patent system was established by the Patent Act of 1790, with Thomas Jefferson as a key figure in its creation.

In the context of commons-aligned value creation, patents present a complex and often contentious issue. On one hand, they can be seen as a tool of enclosure, creating artificial scarcity and limiting the free flow of knowledge and innovation, which is antithetical to the principles of the commons. The exclusive rights granted by patents can hinder collaborative innovation and create barriers to entry for smaller players. On the other hand, patents can be used defensively to protect a commons-oriented project from co-optation by proprietary interests. A strategically managed patent portfolio can serve as a shield, ensuring that the core technology of a project remains open and accessible to its community. This approach, often referred to as a "patent commons" or "defensive patenting," seeks to leverage the patent system to safeguard and promote shared resources rather than to maximize private profit.

### 2. Core Principles

1.  **Limited Monopoly:** The patent holder is granted a temporary, exclusive right to the invention, typically for 20 years from the filing date. This monopoly is the core incentive for inventors to disclose their inventions.
2.  **Public Disclosure:** In exchange for the limited monopoly, the inventor must provide a detailed and enabling disclosure of the invention, which becomes part of the public record. This disclosure is intended to enrich the public domain of knowledge and to enable others to build upon the invention after the patent expires.
3.  **Novelty:** To be patentable, an invention must be new. It cannot have been previously disclosed to the public in any form, anywhere in the world.
4.  **Non-Obviousness (Inventive Step):** The invention must not be obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which the invention pertains. It must represent a genuine inventive step and not merely a trivial modification of existing technology.
5.  **Utility (Industrial Applicability):** The invention must have a useful purpose. It must be capable of being made or used in some kind of industry.

### 3. Key Practices

1.  **Prior Art Search:** Before filing a patent application, a thorough search of existing patents, scientific literature, and other public disclosures is conducted to assess the novelty and non-obviousness of the invention.
2.  **Patent Application Drafting:** A detailed legal document is prepared that includes a specification describing the invention and a set of claims that define the scope of the protection sought.
3.  **Patent Prosecution:** This is the process of negotiating with the patent office to determine the patentability of the invention. It involves responding to office actions, amending claims, and arguing for the allowance of the patent.
4.  **Patent Portfolio Management:** This involves strategically managing a collection of patents to align with business objectives. This can include decisions about which inventions to patent, where to file for patents, and how to maintain or abandon existing patents.
5.  **Freedom to Operate (FTO) Analysis:** This is an analysis to determine whether a proposed product or process infringes on the patent rights of others. It is a crucial step in risk management for any technology-based enterprise.
6.  **Defensive Patenting:** This is the practice of acquiring patents to prevent them from being used by others to block a company's own products or services. It is a strategy to ensure freedom of operation and to deter patent trolls.
7.  **Patent Licensing:** This involves granting permission to others to use a patented invention in exchange for royalties or other considerations. Licensing can be a way to generate revenue and to promote the adoption of a technology.

### 4. Implementation

Implementing a patent strategy requires a careful and considered approach. The first step is to identify the core inventions that are critical to the success of the enterprise. This involves a process of invention disclosure and review, where technical and business teams collaborate to assess the value and patentability of new ideas. Once an invention is identified as a candidate for patent protection, a prior art search should be conducted to gauge the likelihood of obtaining a patent. This search can be conducted by a patent attorney, a specialized search firm, or by the inventors themselves using online patent databases.

If the prior art search is favorable, the next step is to draft and file a patent application. This is a highly specialized task that is best handled by a qualified patent attorney or agent. The application must be carefully drafted to meet all the legal requirements and to provide the broadest possible protection for the invention. After the application is filed, the patent office will conduct an examination and issue an office action, which may include rejections of the claims. The applicant, through their attorney, will then respond to the office action, and this back-and-forth process, known as patent prosecution, will continue until the patent is either granted or finally rejected.

For commons-aligned projects, the implementation of a patent strategy should be guided by the project's values and goals. This may involve a commitment to defensive patenting, where patents are acquired not for offensive litigation but to create a protective commons. It could also involve the use of patent pledges, where the project publicly commits to not asserting its patents against certain types of users or for certain types of uses. The choice of licensing models is also critical. A commons-oriented project might use royalty-free licenses or grant-back provisions to encourage sharing and collaboration. The key is to use the patent system as a tool to support the commons, rather than as a weapon to exclude and dominate.

### 5. 7 Pillars Assessment

| Pillar | Score (1-5) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | 3 | Patents can be used to protect and sustain a commons, but they can also be used for purely extractive purposes. The alignment with a commons purpose depends entirely on the strategy and intent of the patent holder. |
| Governance | 2 | The patent system is a centralized, state-sanctioned system of control. It is not inherently participatory or democratic. However, a commons-oriented project can create its own governance structures around its patent portfolio. |
| Culture | 2 | The culture of the patent system is generally one of competition and exclusion. It can foster secrecy and discourage open collaboration. A conscious effort is required to build a culture of sharing and cooperation in a patent-holding organization. |
| Incentives | 3 | The primary incentive of the patent system is financial reward through monopoly. This can be at odds with the intrinsic motivations that often drive commons-based peer production. However, patents can also provide a sense of security and stability that can be a powerful incentive for contributors. |
| Knowledge | 4 | The patent system mandates the public disclosure of inventions, which contributes to the public domain of knowledge. This is a strong point of alignment with the commons principle of knowledge sharing. |
| Technology | 3 | Patents can be used to protect and promote open standards and interoperable technologies. However, they can also be used to create proprietary lock-in and to block the development of alternative technologies. |
| Resilience | 3 | A defensive patent portfolio can enhance the resilience of a commons by protecting it from external threats. However, an over-reliance on patents can create a rigid and brittle system that is not adaptable to changing circumstances. |
| **Overall** | **4.0** | **Patents are a powerful tool that can be used to either enclose or protect a commons. Their alignment with commons principles is not inherent in the tool itself, but in the strategy and intentionality of its use. A well-crafted defensive patent strategy can be a vital component of a resilient and thriving commons.** |

### 6. When to Use

*   When a core technology is at risk of being patented and enclosed by a competitor.
*   When a project needs to attract investment and patents are seen as a key indicator of value and defensibility.
*   When a project wants to create a "patent commons" or a defensive patent portfolio to protect a particular field of innovation.
*   When a project needs to generate revenue through licensing to sustain its operations.
*   When a project wants to ensure that its technology can be used as a platform for further innovation by others.
*   When a project is operating in a highly litigious industry and needs a defensive shield against patent trolls.

### 7. Anti-Patterns and Gotchas

*   **Patent Trolling:** Acquiring patents with no intention of practicing the invention, but solely for the purpose of asserting them against alleged infringers.
*   **Overly Broad Patents:** Seeking to claim more than what was actually invented, which can stifle innovation and lead to costly litigation.
*   **Submarine Patents:** Intentionally delaying the issuance of a patent to surprise an industry that has already widely adopted the technology.
*   **Ignoring Prior Art:** Failing to conduct a thorough prior art search, which can lead to the issuance of invalid patents and a false sense of security.
*   **Focusing on Quantity over Quality:** Amassing a large portfolio of low-quality patents that provide little real protection and can be a drain on resources.
*   **Using Patents for Exclusion:** Using patents to block competitors and to create a proprietary walled garden, rather than to foster a vibrant ecosystem of innovation.
