# Indigenous Design Principles (Seven Generations)

## 1. Overview

Indigenous Design Principles, deeply rooted in the wisdom of Indigenous cultures worldwide, offer a profound and holistic approach to design that stands in stark contrast to many mainstream, Western-centric design philosophies. These principles are not merely a set of aesthetic guidelines but represent a comprehensive worldview that emphasizes interconnectedness, long-term thinking, and a deep respect for the natural world. At the heart of this approach lies the **Seven Generations Principle**, a powerful concept originating from the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, which posits that the decisions we make today should be mindful of their impact on the seven generations to come [1]. This long-term perspective fundamentally reframes the design process, shifting the focus from short-term gains and immediate gratification to sustainable, equitable, and life-affirming outcomes. The Haudenosaunee Confederacy's constitution, the Great Law of Peace, is believed to have been a model for the American Constitution, and its principles of peace, equity, and respect for the earth are deeply embedded in Indigenous design philosophies [4].

This pattern, "Indigenous Design Principles (Seven Generations)," encapsulates a set of guidelines and a way of thinking that can be applied across various design disciplines, from architecture and urban planning to product design and organizational development. It challenges designers to move beyond a purely functional or aesthetic understanding of their work and to consider the broader social, cultural, and environmental implications of their creations. By integrating Indigenous knowledge systems, which have been developed and refined over millennia, designers can create solutions that are not only more sustainable and resilient but also more deeply connected to place, community, and culture.

Western design paradigms, born out of the Industrial Revolution and modernist ideologies, have often prioritized efficiency, scalability, and economic growth above all else. This has led to a host of unintended consequences, including environmental degradation, social alienation, and a loss of cultural diversity. The emphasis on universal solutions and a "one-size-fits-all" approach has often resulted in designs that are disconnected from their local context and that fail to meet the specific needs of the communities they are intended to serve. In contrast, Indigenous Design Principles offer a powerful alternative, one that is grounded in a deep understanding of place and a commitment to long-term sustainability.

## 2. Core Principles

The Indigenous Design Principles (Seven Generations) pattern is founded on a set of core principles that guide the design process toward creating a more just, sustainable, and resilient world. These principles, drawn from the wisdom of Indigenous cultures, provide a framework for making decisions that honor the past, serve the present, and protect the future.

## 3. Key Practices

Translating the core principles of Indigenous design into practice requires a set of key practices that guide the design process from conception to implementation. These practices are not a rigid set of rules but rather a flexible framework that can be adapted to different contexts and projects.

One of the most important practices is **deep listening**, which involves taking the time to truly understand the needs, values, and aspirations of the community for whom the design is intended. This goes beyond simply conducting surveys or focus groups; it requires building relationships, fostering trust, and engaging in open and honest dialogue. As outlined in the International Indigenous Design Charter, deep listening is a prerequisite for respectful and culturally specific engagement [2].

Another key practice is **co-creation**, which involves actively involving the community in the design process. This means that the designer is not seen as the sole expert but rather as a facilitator who helps the community to articulate its own vision and to develop solutions that are tailored to its specific needs and context. The charter emphasizes that projects should be **Indigenous-led**, with Indigenous stakeholders overseeing the creative development and design process [2].

**Storytelling** is also a powerful practice in Indigenous design. Stories are not just a form of entertainment but a way of transmitting knowledge, values, and cultural traditions from one generation to the next. By incorporating storytelling into the design process, designers can create solutions that are not only functional but also meaningful and culturally resonant.

Finally, the practice of **observing and learning from nature** is central to Indigenous design. Indigenous cultures have a deep understanding of the natural world and have developed sophisticated systems for living in harmony with their environment. By studying these systems, designers can learn how to create solutions that are more sustainable, resilient, and adaptable.

## 4. Application Context

The Indigenous Design Principles (Seven Generations) pattern can be applied in a wide range of contexts, from large-scale urban planning projects to the design of everyday objects. It is particularly relevant in situations where there is a need to create solutions that are sustainable, equitable, and culturally sensitive. This pattern is not limited to projects that are specifically focused on Indigenous communities; it can be used by any designer who is committed to creating a more just and sustainable world.

In the context of **architecture and urban planning**, this pattern can be used to create buildings and cities that are in harmony with the natural environment and that reflect the cultural values of the local community. For example, the Red Lake Nation Tribal College and Tribal Headquarters, designed with input from the community, incorporates cultural symbols and stories into its design, creating a space that is both functional and meaningful [3].

In **product design**, this pattern can be used to create products that are not only beautiful and functional but also durable, repairable, and made from sustainable materials. It encourages a shift away from a disposable consumer culture and toward a more circular economy.

In **organizational design**, this pattern can be used to create organizations that are more democratic, collaborative, and resilient. It encourages a move away from hierarchical structures and toward more distributed and networked models of governance.

In the **digital realm**, this pattern can be applied to the design of software, websites, and online communities. It can help to create digital spaces that are more inclusive, equitable, and respectful of user privacy and data sovereignty.

## 5. Implementation

Implementing the Indigenous Design Principles (Seven Generations) pattern requires a fundamental shift in the way that designers think and work. It is not simply a matter of applying a new set of tools or techniques; it is about embracing a new worldview and a new set of values. The International Indigenous Design Charter provides a valuable 10-step guide for implementation [2].

</tr>
</table>

## 6. Evidence & Impact

The application of Indigenous Design Principles has a demonstrable positive impact on communities and the environment. The case of the Minooskiaindahyung supportive housing project in St. Paul, Minnesota, provides compelling evidence. By engaging with the local Indigenous community and incorporating their cultural values, the project created a space that is not just a shelter but a home that fosters a sense of belonging and cultural identity for homeless Native youth [3]. The ground blessing ceremony, a departure from the typical groundbreaking, imbued the building with a spirit and a name, transforming it into an elder for the community [3].

Similarly, the Red Lake Nation Tribal College and Tribal Headquarters project showcases the power of these principles to create deeply meaningful and symbolic architecture. The design, inspired by the story of eagles returning to the nest, became a powerful symbol of renewal and resilience for the Red Lake Nation [3]. The project's success was not just in its architectural form but in its ability to reflect the community's values and aspirations, as evidenced by the presence of soaring eagles at the grand opening ceremony [3].

The impact of these principles extends beyond individual projects. The International Indigenous Design Charter, a direct outcome of the growing movement to recognize and respect Indigenous knowledge in design, is now a global resource for designers and a testament to the increasing influence of this approach [2]. The charter's 10-step protocol provides a practical framework for designers to engage with Indigenous communities in a respectful and meaningful way, leading to more authentic and impactful design outcomes.

## 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

In the Cognitive Era, characterized by the rise of artificial intelligence, big data, and ubiquitous computing, the Indigenous Design Principles (Seven Generations) pattern offers a crucial counterbalance to the often-dehumanizing tendencies of technology. The principle of **Seven Generations Thinking** is particularly relevant in the context of AI development, where the long-term consequences of algorithmic decisions are often overlooked. By applying this principle, designers and developers can create AI systems that are not only intelligent but also wise, taking into account their potential impact on future generations.

The principle of **interconnectedness** challenges the reductionist approach that often characterizes data analysis and machine learning. It reminds us that data points are not just abstract numbers but represent real people and complex social relationships. This holistic perspective can help to mitigate the risks of algorithmic bias and ensure that AI systems are designed to serve the needs of all members of society, not just the privileged few.

Furthermore, the principle of **cultural appropriateness** is essential for creating AI systems that are respectful of cultural diversity. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into our daily lives, it is crucial that these systems are designed to understand and respond to the nuances of different cultures. This requires a move away from a one-size-fits-all approach and toward a more culturally sensitive and context-aware design process.

Finally, the principle of **reciprocity** can guide the development of more equitable and just data governance models. In an era where data is often referred to as the "new oil," this principle reminds us that data is not just a commodity to be extracted and exploited but a shared resource that should be used for the benefit of all. It encourages the development of data commons and other alternative models of data ownership and control that empower communities and individuals.

## 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

The Indigenous Design Principles (Seven Generations) pattern is strongly aligned with the principles of the commons. It promotes a way of thinking and acting that is based on shared stewardship, long-term sustainability, and collective well-being. This assessment evaluates the pattern against the seven dimensions of commons alignment.
