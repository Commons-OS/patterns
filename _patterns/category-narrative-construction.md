Crafting the founding story of a new category — its origin tension, the old world vs. new world, the key protagonists — so that others can recognise themselves as belonging to it and join.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Narrative / Brand Strategy.

---

### Section 1: Context

A new category emerges when existing boundaries no longer hold the work people are actually doing. In organisations, teams discover they're solving problems that don't fit legacy departments. In movements, activists realise their practice is distinct from established activism. In tech, engineers build products that create entirely new use cases. In public service, practitioners find themselves bridging silos that policy never intended to exist.

At this threshold, the emerging community is fragmented. People feel the coherence of what they're doing, but lack shared language. They work in isolation, unaware others face identical tensions. The system is vitally alive but not yet visible — energy dispersed across disconnected pockets.

A category narrative is the root system that makes this distributed work recognisable as one coherent whole. It names what was previously unnamed. It creates permission for practitioners to claim identity and find each other. Without this narrative, the emerging practice remains invisible to funders, leaders, collaborators, and its own practitioners. The category stays potential rather than kinetic. Growth plateaus because there is no vessel to pour into.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is The Old World vs. New World.**

The Old World operates through established categories — fixed job titles, disciplinary silos, familiar funding mechanisms, proven metrics. Its strength is clarity: everyone knows the rules. Its weakness is rigidity: it cannot hold work that doesn't fit existing boxes.

The New World practitioners are doing something real and coherent, but it violates the old taxonomy. They are simultaneously:
- **Too interdisciplinary** for single-discipline institutions
- **Too practical** for purely theoretical spaces
- **Too systemic** for siloed teams
- **Too novel** for funders trained on legacy categories

The tension surfaces as fragmentation and invisibility. New World practitioners spend energy explaining themselves in Old World language. They cannot access resources, talent, or partnerships because gatekeepers cannot see what they do. Worse, practitioners themselves cannot find each other. The community that should exist remains phantom — present in energy but absent in form.

The break-point comes when this energy dissipates. Talented people leave because they feel alone. Ideas don't compound because practitioners don't know about adjacent work. The emerging practice decays without ever becoming visible. The Old World wins by default, not through strength, but through the new category's failure to articulate itself.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, construct a founding narrative that names the origin tension, describes the Old World/New World contrast, and identifies the key protagonists — so practitioners can recognise themselves in it and claim belonging.**

A category narrative is not marketing copy or brand positioning. It is an act of commons construction. It plants the root system through which distributed practitioners recognise they belong to the same organism.

The mechanism works through **pattern recognition at identity level**. When a practitioner encounters the category narrative and sees themselves reflected in it — their actual frustrations, their actual work, their actual values — something shifts. They move from isolation to coherence. They can now say: *This is what I do. This is who I am. I am not alone.*

This recognition cascades. Once visible, the category becomes a attractor. Resources flow toward it. Collaborators self-organise around it. Institutions reshape to accommodate it. The narrative doesn't create the practice — the practice is already alive — but the narrative makes it legible, claimable, and therefore cultivable.

Living systems language: the narrative is the fruiting body of work already happening underground. It emerges from the actual tensions practitioners face, not from abstract strategy. Its power lies in its fidelity to reality. Practitioners can taste their own work in it.

The Old World vs. New World contrast anchors the narrative in genuine stakes. It does not demonise the old — it honours what the old world did well while naming why it no longer holds the new work. This allows practitioners to claim their category without severing necessary continuities. It also gives practitioners language to explain to old-world gatekeepers *why* the new category matters.

The key protagonists — the actual humans embodying the practice — make the narrative live. Abstract categories don't move people. Stories of real practitioners facing real tensions do. The narrative becomes self-reinforcing: as practitioners see themselves reflected, they bring their own work and networks into the category, deepening it.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**Map the origin tension.** Before writing anything, interview 8–12 practitioners actually doing the work. Not the most famous. The ones in the trenches. Ask: What problem did you face that existing categories couldn't name? What felt different about your work? What did you have to invent because nothing existed? Record exact language. This is your raw material.

**Define the Old World contract.** What was the previous arrangement? How did institutions, funding, careers, and collaboration work? What was its legitimate strength? Name it respectfully. You need old-world practitioners to recognise themselves too — and to understand why the new world is necessary.

**Describe the New World condition.** What has shifted? New technology? Changed human values? Newly visible complexity? Urgent problems the old category ignores? What do new-world practitioners *actually need* that the old system cannot provide? Be specific. "Better collaboration" is vapour. "Cross-sector teams that can move at the speed of crisis response" is real.

**Name the key protagonists.** Identify 3–5 practitioners who embody the category at its best. Not celebrities. People doing the work at different scales and in different sectors. Use their actual names and specific stories. A tech implementation: Netflix engineers building real-time data streaming *and* product teams collaborating with editorial — both are Data Commons practitioners, and that matters. A corporate context: Name the supply-chain manager who built the first peer-owned vendor network *and* the operations director who dismantled departmental hoarding. An activist context: Name the organiser who realised mutual aid networks required commons governance *and* the technologist who built the platform. A government context: Name the public servant who defected from vertical hierarchy to cross-agency coordination *and* the community liaison who demanded co-design rather than top-down policy.

**Craft the narrative arc.** Structure it as: *Tension* (what broke about the old way) → *Awakening* (when practitioners first noticed the new work emerging) → *Recognition* (the moment the category became visible) → *Belonging* (what it means to be part of this now). Keep it under 800 words. Practitioners should be able to share it in a single conversation.

**Test for pattern recognition.** Share the draft with practitioners who were *not* in your original interviews. Do they see themselves? Do they say "Yes, that's what I do, but I didn't have language for it"? If they say "that's interesting," it's not specific enough. Keep refining until practitioners recognise their own work.

**Distribute through lived practice, not broadcast.** Don't publish the narrative and wait. Embed it in practitioner gatherings, onboarding, case studies, and job descriptions. Let it live in conversation before it lives in documents. In tech contexts, weave it into product documentation and engineering culture decks. In corporate contexts, anchor it in hiring criteria and team charters. In activist contexts, use it to recruit and onboard. In government contexts, embed it in cross-agency compacts and service design frameworks.

---

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

The category narrative generates what practitioners call "permission to exist." Teams that were previously hiding their cross-disciplinary work suddenly claim it publicly. They recruit collaborators explicitly around the category. Institutional resources — funding, hiring, promotion — begin flowing toward it because decision-makers can finally see it. Practitioners stop burning out trying to explain themselves; they can instead focus on deepening practice. New practitioners can onboard faster because they have a coherent map of what the work entails. Partnerships accelerate because organisations recognise each other as part of the same ecosystem rather than competitors or unrelated actors.

**What risks emerge:**

The pattern's composability score is strong (4.5), but its stakeholder architecture and resilience are modest (both 3.0). This creates a specific failure mode: **narrative ossification**. Once a category narrative becomes successful and formalised, it hardens. New practitioners who don't fit the original story get excluded. The narrative becomes gatekeeping rather than welcoming. Institutional players co-opt it and drain it of its commons character. The narrative becomes a brand owned by a single organisation rather than a commons stewarded by distributed practitioners.

A second risk: the narrative can be *hollow* — technically accurate but emotionally inert. If it's written by marketing rather than rooted in actual practitioner experience, people sense the falsity. It repels rather than attracts.

Third: the narrative can flatten important diversity. If it tells a story that only works for one regional context, one type of organisation, or one demographic group, it will exclude the practitioners who most need coherence and belonging.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Agile Software Development (2001–2005).** The Manifesto for Agile Software Development is a category narrative. Before it, practitioners developing in short cycles, prioritising collaboration, and responding to change were scattered across companies, doing similar work under different names (XP, Scrum, adaptive development). The manifesto named the origin tension (waterfall couldn't hold modern software complexity), described the Old World (process-heavy, documentation-first, change-resistant) and New World (people-first, iterative, adaptive), and identified key protagonists (Kent Beck, Ron Jeffries, Alistair Cockburn, others). It gave permission for thousands of practitioners to claim identity and find each other. The narrative didn't create agile — the practice was alive — but it made it visible and claimable at scale.

**Platform Cooperativism (2014–present).** Trebor Scholz and others crafted a category narrative distinguishing cooperative digital platforms from extractive venture-backed platforms. The tension: platforms concentrating wealth vs. distributed ownership. The Old World: venture capital, surveillance, labour extraction. The New World: worker and user ownership, algorithmic transparency, equitable value distribution. Key protagonists: drivers in worker co-op rideshares, artists in artist-owned music platforms, farmers in data commons. The narrative was distributed through books, conferences, and case studies. It gave practitioners — particularly in the Global South — permission to build alternative platforms explicitly. It attracted funding dedicated to cooperative models. It created institutional infrastructure (Common Foundation, platform cooperative consortium).

**Participatory Budgeting (1989–present, accelerating 2010s).** Started in Porto Alegre, Brazil with a specific narrative: citizens could directly decide how public money was spent, making government accountable to residents rather than bureaucratic machinery. The Old World: top-down, opaque budget allocation. The New World: transparent, co-determined resource distribution. Key protagonists: residents who showed up, civic organisers who made space for them, government officials who risked their authority. The narrative spread globally because it named something practitioners in many contexts were independently attempting. As the narrative propagated, thousands of municipalities adopted participatory budgeting. The practice deepened where the narrative remained grounded in actual citizen agency, and hollowed where it became ritual without real power.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age of AI and distributed intelligence, category narratives face new leverage and new threat.

**New leverage:** Language models can rapidly test narrative resonance. Practitioners can iteratively generate narrative variations and test them for pattern-recognition against real practitioner language. The bottleneck of "finding the right words" compresses. Communities can co-author narratives collaboratively in real time, with AI reflecting back patterns across many practitioner voices.

**New threat:** AI-generated narratives can be persuasive while remaining hollow. An LLM can craft a narrative that *sounds* like it comes from lived experience without any actual grounding. It will miss the specificity that makes practitioners say *"Yes, that's my work."* Categories built on synthetic narratives will attract people for the wrong reasons and collapse when reality doesn't match story.

**The tech context translation is crucial here.** For products: the category narrative has become a critical mechanism for ecosystems. When platforms like Shopify or Stripe introduce a new product category (vertical SaaS, embedded finance), their founding narrative determines whether independent developers recognise themselves as part of the ecosystem or see it as competition. The narrative function has shifted from external (marketing) to internal (governance and coordination of independent builders). AI makes it easier to craft these narratives — and easier for the narrative to drift from reality into manipulation.

**The net effect:** Category narratives become more important, not less. As the information landscape floods with AI-generated content, practitioners will crave narratives rooted in actual human experience and stakes. The pattern's value lies not in persuasive craft but in fidelity to reality. Practitioners will detect and reject narratives that aren't grounded in their actual work.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

- Practitioners introduce themselves using the category language unprompted: "I'm a Commons Engineer," "I do participatory budgeting work," "I build cooperative platforms." The category has moved from external label to internal identity.
- New practitioners onboarding say: "I didn't know other people were doing this. I thought I was alone." The narrative functioned as a discovery mechanism.
- Practitioners proactively connect across organisations because they recognise each other as part of the same ecosystem. Cross-organisational learning accelerates.
- Institutions begin reshaping structures to accommodate the category. New hiring roles emerge. Funding opens. Departments reorganise. The narrative has shifted institutional reality.

**Signs of decay:**

- The narrative becomes static. Updated only by a central authority rather than evolving through practitioner experience. Practitioners feel it no longer describes their actual work.
- New practitioners feel excluded because they don't fit the original story. The narrative has become gatekeeping. Diversity collapses.
- Practitioners use the category language but hollow it — they talk about "agile mindset" without iterative practice, or "commons" without actual co-ownership. The narrative has decoupled from lived work.
- Institutional actors have captured the narrative for branding. A corporation markets itself as "participatory" while decisions remain top-down. The narrative becomes a commodity rather than a commons.

**When to replant:**

Restart the narrative construction when the practitioner base has transformed so substantially that the original story no longer reflects current reality — typically 5–8 years in fast-moving domains. More important: if you notice practitioners actively disidentifying from the category ("I do that work, but I don't call myself that"), the narrative has decayed and needs redesign rooted in new practitioner interviews.
