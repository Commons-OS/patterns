# 1. Overview

Organizational Development (OD) as conceptualized by Kurt Lewin and later expanded upon by Edgar Schein, is a planned, organization-wide effort to increase an organization's effectiveness and health through planned interventions in the organization's 'processes,' using behavioral-science knowledge. It is a field of applied behavioral science that is concerned with understanding and managing organizational change in a way that enhances both individual and organizational performance. The core of this pattern is a systematic approach to change that considers the complex interplay of individual psychology, group dynamics, and organizational culture.

Lewin's contribution to this field is foundational, particularly his three-stage model of change: unfreezing, changing, and refreezing. This model provides a simple yet powerful framework for thinking about the process of transformation. It emphasizes that before any change can be implemented, the existing equilibrium of the organization must be destabilized or "unfrozen." This involves creating an awareness of the need for change and reducing the forces that resist it. The "changing" stage is where the actual modifications in behavior, processes, or structures are introduced. Finally, the "refreezing" stage is about stabilizing the organization in a new state of equilibrium, ensuring that the changes are integrated into the organization's culture and practices.

Edgar Schein, a student of Lewin's, built upon this foundation by delving deeper into the psychological mechanisms that underpin the change process. He highlighted that for change to be successful, it must occur at a deeper level than just behavior. It requires a shift in the underlying assumptions, values, and beliefs that constitute the organization's culture. Schein's work emphasizes the importance of psychological safety in the change process, arguing that individuals must feel secure enough to let go of old ways of working and embrace new ones. He also introduced the concept of "cognitive redefinition," where individuals come to see and interpret the world in a new way, which is essential for lasting change.

Together, the work of Lewin and Schein provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and managing organizational change. It is a pattern that has been applied in countless organizations across various industries and sectors, and it remains highly relevant in today's rapidly changing world. The pattern is not a rigid set of instructions but rather a set of principles and practices that can be adapted to the specific context of an organization. It is a humanistic approach to change that recognizes the importance of involving people in the process and creating a supportive environment for them to learn and grow.

# 2. Core Principles

The Organizational Development pattern, as shaped by Lewin and Schein, is grounded in a set of core principles that guide its application. These principles are not merely theoretical constructs but are deeply practical and are intended to be applied in a holistic and integrated manner.

**1. Change is a Process, Not an Event:** A fundamental principle of this pattern is that organizational change is a process that unfolds over time, not a one-time event. Lewin's three-stage model of unfreezing, changing, and refreezing provides a clear illustration of this principle. It highlights that change requires a preparatory phase (unfreezing), an implementation phase (changing), and a consolidation phase (refreezing). This process-oriented view of change encourages a more patient and systematic approach, rather than a quick-fix mentality.

**2. The Importance of Psychological Safety:** Schein's work, in particular, emphasizes the critical role of psychological safety in the change process. For individuals to be willing to unlearn old habits and learn new ones, they must feel safe enough to be vulnerable, to make mistakes, and to experiment with new ways of working. Without psychological safety, change efforts are likely to be met with resistance, fear, and anxiety, which can sabotage the entire process. Creating a climate of trust and support is therefore a prerequisite for successful organizational development.

**3. Change Involves Unlearning and Relearning:** This pattern recognizes that change is not just about adding new knowledge or skills; it is also about unlearning old ones. This can be a difficult and even painful process, as it requires individuals to question their long-held assumptions and beliefs. Schein's concept of "cognitive redefinition" is central here. It suggests that for change to be truly transformative, it must involve a fundamental shift in how individuals perceive and make sense of their reality.

**4. The Power of Group Dynamics:** Lewin's background in group dynamics is evident in this pattern. He believed that individual behavior is strongly influenced by the groups to which people belong. Therefore, to change individual behavior, it is often necessary to change the norms and dynamics of the group. This principle suggests that change efforts should focus not just on individuals but also on teams and other social units within the organization.

**5. The Centrality of Culture:** Schein's model of organizational culture, with its three levels of artifacts, espoused values, and underlying assumptions, is a cornerstone of this pattern. It posits that the deepest and most enduring change occurs at the level of underlying assumptions. Therefore, any significant organizational development effort must address the organization's culture. This involves a process of surfacing, examining, and, if necessary, changing the shared assumptions that drive behavior within the organization.

**6. Action Research as a Methodology:** The OD pattern is closely associated with the methodology of action research. This is an iterative process of diagnosing a problem, taking action to address it, and then evaluating the results of that action. This cyclical process of "plan, do, check, act" allows for continuous learning and adaptation throughout the change process. It also emphasizes the importance of collaboration between the change agents and the members of the organization.

**7. A Humanistic and Ethical Stance:** Finally, this pattern is grounded in a humanistic and ethical value system. It views individuals as having the potential for growth and development, and it seeks to create organizations that are not only effective but also humane. This involves treating people with respect, empowering them to participate in decisions that affect them, and fostering a climate of open communication and trust. The ultimate goal of OD is to create a win-win situation where both the organization and its members can thrive.

# 3. Key Practices

The principles of Organizational Development are put into action through a set of key practices that provide a structured way to manage change. The first is **Diagnosis**, a thorough assessment of the organization's current state using methods like surveys, interviews, observations, and analysis of existing data to create a shared understanding of the issues.

**Action Planning:** Following diagnosis, a collaborative action plan is developed, setting clear goals, identifying interventions, and creating a timeline and budget with stakeholder input to ensure realism and support.

**Intervention:** This phase involves implementing planned changes through various interventions like team building, training, process consultation (a Schein specialty), or structural adjustments.

**Evaluation:** The effectiveness of interventions is continuously evaluated by collecting data to measure progress against goals, allowing for ongoing adjustments.

**Institutionalization:** Corresponding to Lewin's "refreezing" stage, this practice makes changes permanent by embedding them in the culture through updated policies, revised reward systems, and promoting change champions.

**Force Field Analysis:** A key Lewinian practice, this tool identifies driving and restraining forces for change, enabling the development of strategies to strengthen support and weaken resistance.

# 4. Application Context

The Organizational Development pattern, with its roots in the work of Lewin and Schein, is highly adaptable and can be applied in a wide range of organizational contexts. Its principles and practices are not confined to a specific industry, sector, or type of organization. However, the specific application of the pattern will vary depending on the unique circumstances of each organization.

**Applicability Across Industries and Sectors:** This pattern has been successfully applied in a diverse array of industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, technology, and financial services. It is also widely used in the public and non-profit sectors. The common thread across these applications is the need to manage change in a way that is both effective and humane. For example, a manufacturing company might use the OD pattern to implement a new quality control system, while a hospital might use it to improve patient safety.

**Scalability:** The OD pattern is scalable and can be applied at different levels of an organization. It can be used for large-scale, organization-wide transformations, such as a merger or acquisition, or for smaller-scale changes within a single department or team. The principles of unfreezing, changing, and refreezing can be applied to a team that is adopting a new software system, just as they can be applied to an entire organization that is undergoing a cultural transformation.

**Types of Change:** This pattern is particularly well-suited for managing complex, adaptive changes, as opposed to simple, technical changes. Technical changes are those that can be solved with existing knowledge and expertise, such as fixing a bug in a software program. Adaptive changes, on the other hand, require a shift in people's values, beliefs, and behaviors. The OD pattern, with its focus on psychology, culture, and group dynamics, provides a robust framework for navigating the complexities of adaptive change.

**Cultural Context:** The application of the OD pattern needs to be sensitive to the cultural context in which it is being used. This is particularly true in a globalized world, where organizations are increasingly diverse and multicultural. Schein's model of culture provides a useful lens for understanding the cultural dynamics of an organization and for tailoring the change process to the specific cultural context. For example, the way in which psychological safety is created may need to be different in a high-context culture compared to a low-context culture.

**Leadership and Sponsorship:** The success of any OD effort is heavily dependent on the support and commitment of leadership. Leaders play a critical role in creating a vision for the change, communicating the need for change, and providing the resources and support that are necessary for implementation. Without strong leadership and sponsorship, change efforts are likely to falter. The OD pattern emphasizes the importance of a collaborative relationship between leaders, change agents, and the members of the organization.

In summary, the Organizational Development pattern is a versatile and powerful tool for managing change. Its applicability is broad, but its successful implementation requires a deep understanding of the specific context in which it is being applied. It is not a one-size-fits-all solution but rather a flexible framework that can be adapted to meet the unique needs of each organization.

# 5. Implementation

Implementing the OD pattern is a cyclical process structured around Lewin's three-stage model, requiring careful planning and execution.

### Phase 1: Unfreezing

This phase creates readiness for change by challenging the status quo. Key steps include a comprehensive and collaborative diagnosis of the current state, a Force Field Analysis to understand driving and restraining forces, the creation of psychological safety and a sense of urgency, and the articulation of a clear and compelling vision for the future.

### Phase 2: Changing

This is the transformation phase where planned interventions are implemented. It involves a project-managed approach to interventions such as team building and leadership development, guided by the iterative principles of action research. Providing support and coaching for employees and celebrating short-term wins are crucial for maintaining momentum.

### Phase 3: Refreezing

The final stage stabilizes the change, making it a permanent part of the organization. This is achieved by integrating changes into the culture, aligning systems and structures to reinforce new behaviors, providing ongoing reinforcement through recognition and leadership modeling, and continuously monitoring and evaluating the impact of the changes.

# 6. Evidence & Impact

The OD pattern, with its roots in the work of Lewin and Schein, has a well-documented history of successful application, supported by both qualitative and quantitative research.

**Empirical and Case Study Evidence:** The effectiveness of OD is supported by a large body of research, including meta-analyses showing positive impacts on financial performance, productivity, and employee satisfaction (e.g., Macy & Izumi, 1993; Neuman, Edwards, & Raju, 1989). This is complemented by numerous case studies demonstrating the pattern's power in addressing diverse organizational challenges.



**Impact on Effectiveness and Well-being:** The OD pattern enhances organizational effectiveness by improving communication, collaboration, and problem-solving, leading to greater agility and innovation. It also positively impacts employee well-being by fostering a more humane and supportive work environment, which can reduce stress and increase job satisfaction.



**Developing Change Capability:** A key impact of the OD pattern is the development of an organization's internal capacity for change. By teaching the skills of diagnosis, action planning, and evaluation, it fosters a culture of continuous learning, equipping the organization to manage future changes effectively.

In conclusion, the evidence for the effectiveness of the Organizational Development pattern is strong and multifaceted. Its impact can be seen in improved organizational performance, enhanced employee well-being, and the development of a more adaptive and resilient organization. While the specific results will vary depending on the context and the quality of the implementation, the OD pattern provides a robust and reliable framework for achieving positive and lasting change.

# 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

In the Cognitive Era, characterized by rapid technological advancement, ubiquitous connectivity, and the primacy of knowledge work, the principles of Organizational Development as laid out by Lewin and Schein are not only still relevant but are arguably more critical than ever. However, the application of these principles needs to be adapted to the unique challenges and opportunities of this new era.

**1. The Pace of Change:** The Cognitive Era is marked by an unprecedented pace of change. This means that the traditional, linear model of unfreeze-change-refreeze may need to be adapted to a more cyclical and continuous process. Organizations can no longer afford to go through a lengthy refreezing process, as they need to be constantly adapting to new technologies, new market conditions, and new customer expectations. The focus needs to be on creating a culture of continuous learning and adaptation, where change is the norm, not the exception.

**2. The Nature of Work:** The nature of work in the Cognitive Era is increasingly complex, knowledge-based, and collaborative. This means that the traditional, top-down approach to change is no longer effective. Instead, change needs to be a more distributed and emergent process, with employees at all levels of the organization involved in identifying the need for change and in co-creating the solutions. The emphasis needs to be on empowering employees and on creating a culture of psychological safety where they feel comfortable experimenting and taking risks.

**3. The Role of Technology:** Technology is a double-edged sword in the Cognitive Era. On the one hand, it is a major driver of change, forcing organizations to constantly adapt. On the other hand, it can also be a powerful enabler of change. For example, social technologies can be used to facilitate communication and collaboration during the change process, and data analytics can be used to provide real-time feedback on the impact of the change. The OD pattern needs to be integrated with a sophisticated understanding of how to leverage technology to support the change process.

**4. The Importance of Learning:** In the Cognitive Era, the ability to learn is the most important competitive advantage. The OD pattern, with its emphasis on unlearning and relearning, is therefore highly relevant. However, the focus needs to be not just on individual learning but also on organizational learning. This means creating systems and processes that enable the organization to learn from its experience and to continuously improve its performance.

**5. The Distributed Workforce:** The rise of remote and distributed work presents new challenges for the application of the OD pattern. It is more difficult to create a sense of psychological safety and to foster a strong culture when people are not physically co-located. This means that leaders need to be more intentional about building relationships, fostering trust, and creating a sense of community in a virtual environment.

In conclusion, the core principles of the Organizational Development pattern remain highly relevant in the Cognitive Era. However, the application of these principles needs to be adapted to the new realities of the 21st-century organization. The focus needs to be on creating a more agile, adaptive, and learning-oriented approach to change, one that is capable of thriving in a world of constant disruption.

# 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

The Organizational Development pattern, as articulated by Lewin and Schein, has a mixed but generally positive alignment with the principles of a commons-based approach to organizing. The assessment across the seven dimensions of commons alignment reveals a pattern that, while not explicitly designed as a commons-based framework, contains many elements that are congruent with and supportive of commons principles.

**1. Openness and Transparency (3/5):** The OD pattern, particularly in its emphasis on action research and collaborative diagnosis, promotes a degree of openness and transparency. The process of gathering data and feeding it back to the organization is inherently transparent. However, the level of openness can vary depending on the specific implementation and the willingness of leadership to share information. There is no inherent requirement for radical transparency, and in some cases, the process can be managed in a more top-down and controlled manner.

**2. Equipotentiality and Peer Governance (3/5):** The pattern's emphasis on participation and involvement is aligned with the principle of equipotentiality. By involving employees in the diagnosis and planning of change, it acknowledges their capacity to contribute to the organization's development. However, the model still retains a role for leaders and change agents, and it does not necessarily lead to a fully peer-governed system. The degree of peer governance will depend on the extent to which leadership is willing to devolve power and decision-making authority.

**3. Experimentalism and Continuous Learning (5/5):** This is where the OD pattern shows its strongest alignment with commons principles. The action research methodology at the heart of OD is a deeply experimental and learning-oriented process. The cyclical process of plan-do-check-act is a perfect embodiment of the principle of continuous learning. The pattern is designed to help organizations learn from their experience and to continuously adapt and improve.

**4. Holism and Systemic Health (4/5):** The OD pattern takes a holistic and systemic view of the organization. It recognizes that an organization is a complex system of interconnected parts and that change in one part of the system will have an impact on other parts. The focus on organizational health and effectiveness, rather than just on narrow financial metrics, is also aligned with the principle of systemic health.

**5. Polycentricity and Pluralism (3/5):** The OD pattern can be applied in a way that is consistent with the principles of polycentricity and pluralism. By encouraging a distributed and participatory approach to change, it can help to create a more polycentric organization. However, the pattern itself does not explicitly call for a polycentric governance structure. The extent to which it promotes pluralism will depend on the willingness of the organization to embrace diversity and to value different perspectives.

**6. Stewardship and Common Good (3/5):** The humanistic values that underpin the OD pattern are aligned with the principle of stewardship and the common good. The pattern seeks to create organizations that are not only effective but also humane. However, the focus is primarily on the good of the organization and its members, and there is less emphasis on the broader common good of society or the environment. The alignment with this dimension could be strengthened by explicitly incorporating a broader stakeholder perspective.

**7. Sufficiency and Frugality (2/5):** The OD pattern does not have a strong alignment with the principles of sufficiency and frugality. The focus is on organizational effectiveness and growth, and there is no inherent critique of consumerism or the pursuit of endless growth. However, the pattern could be used to help an organization transition to a more sustainable and frugal business model, if that were the desired goal.

**Overall Commons Alignment Score: 3/5**

In summary, the Organizational Development pattern is a valuable tool for any organization that is seeking to become more adaptive, resilient, and humane. While it is not a fully-fledged commons-based framework, it contains many elements that are congruent with commons principles. By consciously applying the pattern in a way that emphasizes transparency, participation, and a commitment to the common good, it can be a powerful enabler of a more commons-oriented way of organizing.
