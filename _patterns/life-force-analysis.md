Identifying what gives you life—activities, people, places, work—versus what drains you enables designing more of the former and less of the latter.

### Section 1: Context

Systems fragment when people spend their days doing work that contradicts what sustains them. A government official tasked with compliance may have entered public service to solve problems for communities. A corporate executive managing quarterly targets may have built their career on invention. An engineer shipping features may have joined to build resilient infrastructure. An activist running logistics for a campaign may be strongest at relationship-weaving, not task-driving.

In each case, the system—whether a team, agency, organisation, or movement—is running on borrowed energy. People show up. Work gets done. But the renewable substrate beneath that work atrophies. Over months or years, this manifests as burnout, departure, or the slow calcification of initiative into routine. The commons loses both the person and the insight they carried.

Life Force Analysis emerges from the recognition that a living system cannot sustain itself by ignoring what keeps its members alive. This is not wellness theatre. It is structural ecology. When you map what genuinely energises the people stewarding a commons—not what *should* energise them, but what *does*—you reveal design leverage. You can reorganise roles, delegate, eliminate work, or restructure collaboration to align what the system needs with what its members can give without depletion.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Life vs. Analysis.**

Analysis wants clarity, data, rational justification. It asks: *What is this person assigned to do? What does the role description say? What does the team need?* It builds accountability structures and predictable workflows. It scales.

Life wants renewal, authenticity, the felt sense of purpose. It asks: *What makes this person come alive? When do they lose track of time? Where do they find themselves generating rather than grinding?* It resists being reduced to data. It cannot be forced.

When unresolved, this tension creates a false choice. Either you optimise the system (roles, metrics, efficiency) and watch people quietly drain. Or you prioritise individual flourishing and lose coherence—the commons fragments into isolated preference-tending.

The cost is compound. A drained team member's work decays in quality even as they show up on time. A system that ignores life force leaks institutional memory and tacit knowledge when people eventually leave. Organisations become archives of burnout rather than living ecosystems. Activist networks sustain momentum only through constant recruitment to replace the exhausted. Government agencies become process-bound, unable to adapt because the people who learned the informal workarounds have departed.

The tension is real because it reflects a genuine trade-off: standardised systems run on consistency, not aliveness. But the pattern reveals that this need not be binary. The question is not whether to analyse or to honour life force, but how to let one inform the other.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, practitioners conduct a deliberate, written inventory of what genuinely energises and depletes each person stewarding the commons, then redesign roles, workflows, and delegations to increase alignment between what the system needs and what people can give sustainably.**

This pattern works by shifting from *assigned identity* to *actual vitality*. Instead of asking "What is your job?", you ask "When do you feel most alive doing work that matters?" The difference is not semantic. One question anchors you to role description. The other roots you in the living substrate.

The mechanism operates at multiple scales. At the individual level, articulating what gives life creates self-knowledge that resists denial. You cannot unsee that you drain in meetings but thrive in direct design work, or that you energise others but deplete yourself in solo execution. Once named, this becomes redesignable.

At the team level, collecting these inventories reveals patterns. Three people come alive in synthesis work; two in execution; one in navigation and boundary-holding. A commons that has been organised by org chart alone can now be reorganised by energy topology. Roles shift. Delegation flows differently. The same work gets done, but by people for whom it is renewable.

At the system level, this pattern creates feedback loops. When a commons demonstrates that it values aliveness alongside output, people report more honestly about depletion. Trust increases. The inventory becomes a shared document, not a confessional. Over time, the organisation learns to design for resilience rather than heroism.

The pattern roots in Energy Management tradition's understanding that sustainable productivity requires attending to the conditions that renew effort. It connects to Values Alignment by making explicit the work that expresses what people actually care for—not aspirational values, but lived ones.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

The pattern unfolds in three phases: **Inventory**, **Analysis**, **Redesign**.

**Inventory phase**: Invite each person stewarding the commons to write privately about their work week. Ask three specific questions: *(1) Which activities left you energised—wanting to continue, losing track of time?* *(2) Which activities depleted you—requiring willpower to stay present, draining energy that didn't return?* *(3) Which people, conversations, or places amplified your aliveness?* This is not performance review. Frame it explicitly as design research. Responses stay confidential unless the person chooses to share.

For **corporate** contexts: Frame this as "identifying high-impact work patterns." A product executive mapping this discovers she energises in breakthrough problem-solving with design partners but depletes in stakeholder alignment meetings. Delegating the latter to a chief of staff who thrives on coalition-building doesn't reduce accountability—it increases coherence.

For **government** contexts: Ground this in "improving public service sustainability." A policy director learns that his team's strongest connector energises in deep community listening but is scheduled in back-to-back office meetings. Moving her to lead quarterly community forums while delegating her committee attendance shifts where her aliveness goes—and the quality of intelligence the agency receives improves.

For **activist** contexts: Position this as "building campaign resilience." An organiser discovers her energy multiplies when she's weaving relationships across groups but drains when managing logistics spreadsheets. Rather than making her a logistics coordinator because "someone has to," you find the person for whom coordination is alive work, and you free her to do convening.

For **tech** contexts: Frame this as "optimising for sustainable velocity." An engineer learns she builds deep focus and generates elegant solutions when uninterrupted but energises team morale through pairing and mentorship. The team redesigns her calendar to protect focus time and creates structured pairing blocks—same person, different rhythm, both her gifts in motion.

**Analysis phase**: Collect the inventories (anonymised if needed) and map patterns. What work do people come alive doing? What work consistently depletes? Are there people whose aliveness feeds others' aliveness? Are there bottlenecks where critical work drains everyone who touches it?

This is not about perfect matching. It is about revealing where misalignment is structural and fixable. A team may discover that regulatory compliance depletes everyone, but one person energises when she redesigns the process to be transparent and participatory rather than defensive. Now compliance becomes energising for her and less burdensome for others.

**Redesign phase**: Hold structured conversations with each person and the broader team about how to reshape work allocation. This is not "do what makes you happy." It is "given what the commons needs to do, and given what makes each of us renewable, how do we reorganise?"

Specific moves: (1) **Delegate toward aliveness**: If person A depletes in conflict navigation but person B energises there, restructure so B does more navigating. (2) **Batch depleting work**: Rather than spreading it thin across everyone, concentrate it with people for whom it is less draining, then create space for them to renew. (3) **Create reciprocal exchange**: One person's depletion becomes another's aliveness opportunity. Map these explicitly. (4) **Redesign roles, not people**: Avoid asking someone to change their nature. Reshape what they're responsible for. (5) **Protect focus conditions**: If aliveness depends on uninterrupted time, design structures (quiet hours, async-first, protected days) that enable it.

Document the resulting design. Share it. Revisit quarterly. Life force is not static; it shifts as work evolves and people grow.

---

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

A commons that aligns work with genuine aliveness generates quality that assigned work cannot match. People bring their full attention because they're not fighting their own nature to show up. Tacit knowledge stays in the system longer because people don't burn out and leave. Adaptation accelerates because people who energise in learning and evolution stay engaged long enough to become wise. Relationships deepen because energy that would have been spent on depletion management now goes toward collaboration. The commons develops a reputation that attracts people whose aliveness matches its real work—not people seeking an ideal job description.

Organisational learning improves. When people aren't exhausted, they have cognitive capacity to reflect, experiment, and course-correct. Mistakes become visible earlier. Institutional memory compounds rather than resets with each departure.

**What risks emerge:**

The pattern can become **hollow routine** if the inventory is conducted once and then archived. Life force shifts. Roles that energised someone for two years may become draining. Without revisiting the practice, you build a static alignment that decays into the same misalignment you started with. (Note: Resilience scores 3.0—watch for this rigidity specifically.)

**Preference inflation**: Without clear criteria, "what gives me life" can drift into pure preference or convenience. The pattern requires grounding: *Does this align with what the commons actually needs? Can I sustain it long-term?* Otherwise, you build a system optimised for individual comfort, not collective capacity.

**Hidden depletion**: Some people will not name their depletion honestly—either from shame, from fearing consequences, or from having internalised that their needs don't matter. The pattern relies on psychological safety you may not have built yet. If trust is low, the inventory captures only what people feel safe revealing.

**Equity blindness**: Life force analysis can inadvertently reinforce existing power. If certain people's aliveness is seen as "valuable" while others' is seen as "preference," you amplify hierarchy. A CEO's need for focus time becomes structural protection; a frontline worker's is seen as resistance.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Example 1: City Planning Department Renewal**

A mid-sized city's planning department was losing experienced planners to burnout at alarming rates. Promotions meant moving into management, where those planners spent their days in budget meetings and performance reviews—work that drained them systematically. The department conducted Life Force Analysis and discovered a pattern: their strongest planners energised in deep site analysis and community design engagement. Their burnout pathway forced them away from that work into administrative roles they'd never chosen.

They redesigned their hierarchy. Instead of a linear promotion track, they created two paths: one into management (for people who energised in team leadership), one into senior practitioner roles (for people who energised in planning depth). Salary and recognition matched. The planners who'd been half-present in management returned to site work. Turnover stabilized. The department retained institutional knowledge. This was energy management meeting organisational design.

**Example 2: Open Source Community Sustainability**

A successful open-source project had built vibrant momentum but was running on volunteer energy that showed signs of depletion. Core maintainers were burning out. The project conducted an informal Life Force Analysis: which maintainers energised in code review? Which in documentation? Which in community communication? Which in architecture decisions?

They learned that their most burned-out maintainer thrived on deep architectural thinking but was trapped in reactive issue triage. They hired a part-time community coordinator (someone for whom community triage was genuinely alive work) and restructured the maintainer's time to focus on design. The burnout lifted. The project's technical direction clarified. The community felt more attended to, not less, because the person leading it was doing work that was renewable for them.

**Example 3: Activist Network Evolution**

An activist network spanning five cities had built powerful campaigns but noticed that organisers in smaller cities were quieter, less present, less creative in their local work. Life Force Analysis revealed an invisible pattern: the "high energy" organisers in major cities energised in citywide strategy and cross-city coordination. The organizers in smaller cities energised in deep local relationship-building and hyper-local campaign design. But the network's communication and resource flows were all oriented toward the citywide work, draining the local organisers.

They restructured their governance and communication rhythms to centre local autonomy and local strategy. The citywide team shifted from directing to supporting. Smaller city campaigns became more distinctive, more rooted, more resilient. Turnover decreased. Momentum deepened because it was now held by people energised in the work they were actually doing.

---

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an era of AI and networked commons, Life Force Analysis becomes both more critical and more complex.

**More critical** because AI will handle increasing volumes of standardised work—compliance reporting, data analysis, routine communication. The work left for humans will be precisely the work that demands renewal: creativity, judgment in novel situations, holding relationships, navigating genuine conflict. A commons that has ignored life force through an era of routine work will lack capacity for the adaptive work ahead. Conversely, a commons that has built strong alignment between aliveness and contribution can evolve faster. The people doing the complex work are people for whom that work is renewable.

**More complex** because AI introduces new forms of depletion. Monitoring AI outputs, managing its failure modes, navigating the anxiety of obsolescence—these are draining in new ways. A tech engineer might have energised in building elegant systems but now finds herself debugging opaque machine-learning pipelines that don't reflect her values. The pattern requires expansion: what energises people in collaboration with AI systems? What kinds of AI work are actually renewable?

Distributed commons face new dynamics. In a network where work is asynchronous and text-mediated, the signals of life force shift. Someone may energise in deep async dialogue but drain in synchronous video calls, or vice versa. Life Force Analysis needs to include modality: *Which communication forms energise you? Which work rhythms?*

AI also creates opportunity for redesign at scale. If you have clear data on what energises each person stewarding a commons—their actual work patterns, their stated energy maps—you can begin to automate or restructure the parts that drain, with far more precision than guessing. An AI assistant might handle the administrative parts of a meeting that drain a leader, freeing them for the relational parts that energise them.

The risk: AI could be used to intensify misalignment. If an algorithm optimises you into work that matches your assigned role rather than your life force, you've been machine-locked into depletion. The pattern requires staying intentional: Life Force Analysis is not input to an optimisation algorithm. It is input to *human* redesign of human work.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

*(1)* People articulate their work with genuine specificity. Not "I'm a project manager" but "I energise when I'm weaving together disparate teams around a shared goal, and I drain in status-report cycles." This precision indicates the pattern is living, not performed. *(2)* Role adjustments happen visibly and without drama—people shift responsibilities, delegation flows, work gets reorganised in response to what became clear in the inventory. The commons treats redesign as normal, not as favour or exception. *(3)* Retention of experienced people improves, and new people report faster integration because roles actually match what they're built for. *(4)* The commons develops reputation for sustainability—people want to join not because it's prestigious but because they can see themselves staying energised there.

**Signs of decay:**

*(1)* The Life Force Analysis inventory becomes a checkbox exercise, conducted annually, filed, never referenced. The commons has absorbed the language ("we value aliveness") without changing structure. This is the primary decay pattern for this practice—it becomes ritual without teeth. *(2)* Depletion creeps back in silently; people stop naming it honestly because they learned nothing changed last time they spoke up. *(3)* New roles are still assigned by org chart or need rather than by alignment with actual aliveness. The inventory becomes a confessional rather than a design tool. *(4)* The commons begins losing the experienced people again—not in a visible crisis, but in the quiet departures that signal misalignment has calcified.

**When to replant:**

If you notice decay setting in—if the inventory has become routine without redesign, or if depletion is rising again—restart the practice with a specific prompt: *What has changed since we last did this? What did we get wrong about your aliveness?* This is not starting over; it is allowing the practice to evolve with the living system it serves. The right moment to replant is before burnout reaches crisis, when people still have enough energy to articulate what they need.
