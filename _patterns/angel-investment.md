# FF003: Angel Investment

### 1. Overview

Angel investment is a form of private equity financing where an affluent individual, known as an angel investor or business angel, provides capital for a business start-up, typically in exchange for convertible debt or ownership equity. The core purpose of angel investing is to bridge the funding gap for early-stage companies that are too new or too risky for traditional venture capitalists or bank loans. These investors provide the critical "seed" funding that enables entrepreneurs to develop their ideas, build prototypes, and gain initial market traction. The problem that angel investment solves is the acute shortage of capital for nascent enterprises. Many promising startups fail not due to a lack of innovation, but because they lack the financial resources to survive their initial, cash-intensive phases. Angel investors step into this high-risk environment, providing not just money but often invaluable mentorship, industry expertise, and access to their networks.

The term "angel" originates from the world of Broadway theater, where wealthy patrons would provide the necessary funds to rescue struggling productions from closure. Its application to business was popularized in the late 1970s by William Wetzel, a professor at the University of New Hampshire and founder of the Center for Venture Research, who studied how entrepreneurs raised seed capital. He used the term to describe the individuals who provided this crucial early-stage support. Over the decades, angel investing has evolved from an informal practice into a more structured ecosystem, with angel groups, networks, and online platforms facilitating connections between investors and entrepreneurs. This evolution has democratized access to early-stage capital, though the fundamental principle of a high-net-worth individual backing a promising venture remains the same.

In the context of commons-aligned value creation, angel investment presents a complex and dualistic nature. On one hand, the conventional model of angel investing is fundamentally extractive, focused on maximizing financial returns for the investor through an equity stake, which often leads to an exit strategy (like an acquisition or IPO) that may compromise the commons-oriented mission of the startup. However, a growing movement of "impact" or "values-aligned" angel investors is changing this dynamic. These investors prioritize social and environmental returns alongside financial ones. By investing in commons-oriented projects, social enterprises, and platform cooperatives, they can provide the necessary capital for these alternative models to flourish. Their involvement can be structured to align with commons principles, for instance, by using non-extractive financing instruments like revenue-sharing agreements or by taking on a stewardship role that protects the company's mission. Thus, while not inherently a commons-aligned pattern, angel investment can be a powerful tool for building the commons when the investor's motivations and the investment structure are consciously aligned with that goal.

### 2. Core Principles

1.  **High-Risk, High-Return Investing:** Angel investing is characterized by its high-risk nature. Investors are backing unproven business models and technologies, and the failure rate is substantial. To compensate for this risk, angels seek opportunities with the potential for exponential growth and a significant return on investment, often looking for a 10x or greater return within a 5-7 year timeframe.

2.  **"Smart Money" Contribution:** Beyond capital, angel investors often provide "smart money," which includes their expertise, mentorship, and network. Many angels are successful entrepreneurs or executives themselves and can offer invaluable guidance on strategy, operations, and market positioning. This hands-on involvement is a key differentiator from more passive forms of investment.

3.  **Focus on the Entrepreneur/Team:** At the early stage, with limited data and market validation, angel investors often "bet on the jockey, not the horse." The quality, passion, and resilience of the founding team are paramount. Investors look for entrepreneurs with deep domain expertise, a clear vision, and the ability to execute on their plans.

4.  **Portfolio Diversification:** Given the high failure rate of individual startups, a core principle for professional angel investors is to build a diversified portfolio. By investing in a range of companies across different industries and stages, they can mitigate risk and increase the likelihood of having one or more successful exits that will cover the losses from the rest of the portfolio.

5.  **Long-Term Partnership:** Angel investments are not short-term loans. They represent a long-term partnership between the investor and the entrepreneur. This relationship is built on trust, shared vision, and a commitment to navigating the challenges of building a company together. The typical investment horizon is several years, and the investor is often involved until a significant liquidity event occurs.

6.  **Alignment of Interests:** A successful angel investment requires a strong alignment of interests between the investor and the entrepreneur. This is typically achieved through an equity stake, which ensures that both parties are motivated to increase the value of the company. However, it is crucial to establish clear expectations and a shared understanding of the company's goals and exit strategy from the outset.

### 3. Key Practices

1.  **Deal Sourcing:** Angels find investment opportunities through various channels, including personal networks, referrals from other investors or entrepreneurs, angel groups, pitch events, and online platforms like AngelList. Proactive deal sourcing is essential to find high-quality opportunities.

2.  **Due Diligence:** Before investing, angels conduct thorough due diligence to assess the viability of the business. This process involves evaluating the market size, the product or technology, the competitive landscape, the financial projections, and, most importantly, the founding team. Due diligence can range from informal conversations to a more structured process involving legal and financial experts.

3.  **Valuation and Term Sheet:** Determining the valuation of an early-stage company is more of an art than a science. It is typically negotiated between the investor and the entrepreneur and is based on factors like the team's experience, the market opportunity, and comparable deals. The terms of the investment are outlined in a term sheet, which covers the amount of investment, the valuation, the type of security (e.g., common stock, preferred stock, convertible note), and the rights of the investor.

4.  **Active Mentorship and Support:** Many angels take an active role in their portfolio companies. This can involve regular meetings with the founders, serving on the board of directors, making introductions to potential customers or partners, and providing strategic advice. The level of involvement varies depending on the investor's expertise and the needs of the company.

5.  **Syndication:** To pool capital and share due diligence, many angels invest as part of a syndicate or an angel group. This allows them to make larger investments and benefit from the collective wisdom of the group. Syndication is a common practice that helps to de-risk individual investments.

6.  **Follow-on Funding:** Angel investors often participate in subsequent funding rounds to protect their ownership stake and continue to support the company as it grows. The ability and willingness to provide follow-on funding is an important consideration for entrepreneurs when choosing an investor.

7.  **Exit Strategy:** Angel investors realize their return on investment through an exit event, which is typically an acquisition by a larger company or an initial public offering (IPO). A clear and realistic exit strategy is a key consideration for angels when evaluating an investment opportunity.

8.  **Legal and Financial Structuring:** Angel investments involve complex legal and financial structures. It is essential to have experienced legal counsel to draft and review the investment documents, which include the term sheet, the stock purchase agreement, and the shareholders' agreement. Proper structuring is crucial to protect the interests of both the investor and the entrepreneur.

### 4. Implementation

Implementing the angel investment pattern requires a structured approach from both the entrepreneur seeking funding and the individual looking to become an angel investor. For the entrepreneur, the first step is to develop a compelling business plan and a pitch deck that clearly articulates the problem, the solution, the market opportunity, and the team's expertise. The next step is to identify and connect with potential angel investors who have an interest in their industry. This can be done through networking, attending industry events, and leveraging online platforms. Once a potential investor is identified, the entrepreneur needs to be prepared for a rigorous due diligence process. If the investor is interested, they will negotiate a term sheet, which will be followed by legal documentation and the transfer of funds. After the investment is made, the entrepreneur should maintain a transparent and collaborative relationship with the investor, providing regular updates and seeking their guidance.

For the aspiring angel investor, the journey begins with self-education and an assessment of their financial capacity and risk tolerance. It is crucial to understand the high-risk nature of angel investing and to only invest what one can afford to lose. The next step is to develop an investment thesis, which defines the industries, business models, and stages of companies that the investor wants to focus on. Joining an angel group is a highly recommended practice for new investors, as it provides access to deal flow, shared due diligence, and the opportunity to learn from experienced investors. When evaluating an investment opportunity, the investor should conduct their own due diligence, even if they are part of a syndicate. This includes meeting the founders, testing the product, and talking to industry experts. Once an investment is made, the angel should decide on their desired level of involvement and be prepared to provide support and mentorship to the entrepreneur.

A real-world example of angel investment is the early funding of Google. In 1998, before Google was even a company, its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, received a $100,000 investment from Andy Bechtolsheim, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems. This initial investment was crucial for Google to get off the ground. Another example is the story of WhatsApp, which was funded in its early days by a group of angel investors, including former colleagues from Yahoo. These investments provided the necessary capital for WhatsApp to build its product and grow its user base, eventually leading to its acquisition by Facebook for $19 billion. These examples illustrate the transformative power of angel investment in turning innovative ideas into world-changing companies.

### 5. 7 Pillars Assessment

| Pillar | Score (1-5) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | 3 | Angel investment can support purpose-driven ventures, but its primary motive is often financial return, which can create tension with a commons-oriented mission. |
| Governance | 2 | The governance structure of an angel-funded company is typically shareholder-centric, which can marginalize the interests of other stakeholders. However, alternative structures like steward-ownership can be used to align governance with commons principles. |
| Culture | 3 | The culture of an angel-funded startup is often focused on rapid growth and achieving an exit, which can be at odds with the more patient and collaborative culture of a commons-oriented enterprise. |
| Incentives | 2 | The primary incentive in angel investing is financial return through an equity exit. This can create a short-term focus and a pressure to sell the company, which may not be in the best interest of the commons. |
| Knowledge | 4 | Angel investors often bring valuable knowledge and expertise to a startup. This can be a significant contribution to the commons, especially if the knowledge is shared openly. |
| Technology | 4 | Angel investment can enable the development of innovative technologies that can be used to build and support the commons. |
| Resilience | 3 | Angel investment can provide the necessary capital for a startup to survive its early stages, but the pressure for a quick exit can also make the company less resilient in the long run. |
| **Overall** | **3.2** | **Angel investment is a powerful tool that can be used to build the commons, but it is not inherently commons-aligned. The alignment depends heavily on the motivations of the investor and the structure of the investment.** |

### 6. When to Use

*   **Early-Stage Funding:** When a startup is too early for venture capital or bank loans and needs seed funding to get off the ground.
*   **Validation and Credibility:** An investment from a reputable angel investor can provide valuable validation and credibility for a startup, making it easier to attract customers, partners, and future funding.
*   **Access to Expertise and Networks:** When a startup needs more than just money and can benefit from the mentorship, industry expertise, and network of an experienced angel investor.
*   **Rapid Growth:** When a startup has a scalable business model and is looking to grow quickly.
*   **Bridging to the Next Round:** Angel investment can be used as a bridge to a larger Series A funding round.
*   **Alternative to Traditional Funding:** For entrepreneurs who want to avoid the more rigid and demanding terms of traditional venture capital.

### 7. Anti-Patterns and Gotchas

*   **"Dumb Money":** Taking money from an investor who does not have relevant expertise or cannot add value beyond the capital they provide.
*   **Misalignment of Interests:** A lack of clarity and agreement on the company's goals, vision, and exit strategy can lead to conflict between the entrepreneur and the investor.
*   **Giving Away Too Much Equity:** Entrepreneurs should be careful not to give away too much equity in the early stages, as this can dilute their ownership and control of the company.
*   **Over-reliance on a Single Investor:** Relying on a single angel investor can be risky, as the investor may not be able to provide follow-on funding or may have a change of heart.
*   **Ignoring Due Diligence:** Entrepreneurs should also conduct their own due diligence on potential investors to ensure that they are a good fit for the company.
*   **Accepting Unfavorable Terms:** Entrepreneurs should be wary of investors who offer unfavorable terms, such as a low valuation, a large liquidation preference, or a participating preferred stock.
