# Impact Investors

### 1. Overview

Impact investing is a strategic approach that seeks to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impact alongside a financial return [1]. The core purpose of this pattern is to mobilize capital to address pressing global challenges, such as climate change, inequality, and lack of access to essential services like healthcare and education. Unlike traditional investing, which primarily focuses on financial returns, impact investing intentionally targets a dual bottom line: financial and social/environmental. This approach is not philanthropy, as impact investors expect to recoup their principal and generate further financial gains, but it moves beyond purely financial metrics to include the broader effects of an investment on society and the planet.

The problem that impact investing addresses is the significant funding gap for social and environmental solutions that traditional financial markets often fail to support. Many ventures with the potential for substantial positive impact are considered too risky or offer returns that are not competitive enough for mainstream investors. Impact investors fill this crucial gap by providing capital to social enterprises, non-profits, and other organizations that are developing innovative solutions. The term "impact investing" was coined in 2007 at a gathering hosted by the Rockefeller Foundation, but its roots can be traced back to earlier forms of socially responsible investing and faith-based investing [2].

Impact investing is highly relevant to commons-aligned value creation as it provides a mechanism to finance and scale initiatives that build and steward shared resources. By directing capital towards projects that prioritize community well-being, ecological sustainability, and equitable governance, impact investors can help foster a more regenerative and just economy. This pattern supports the development of commons-based enterprises that might otherwise struggle to secure funding, thereby contributing to the growth of a vibrant and resilient commons sector.

### 2. Core Principles

1.  **Define strategic impact objective(s), consistent with the investment strategy.** The investor must clearly define the social or environmental objectives they aim to achieve, ensuring these goals are aligned with their overall investment strategy and are measurable [3].
2.  **Manage strategic impact on a portfolio basis.** Impact should be managed across the entire portfolio, not just on an individual investment basis. This includes setting impact performance targets for the portfolio and considering the alignment of staff incentives with impact goals [3].
3.  **Establish the Manager’s contribution to the achievement of impact.** The investor should be able to articulate and document their specific contribution to the achievement of the intended impact, whether it be financial, non-financial, or both [3].
4.  **Assess the expected impact of each investment, based on a systematic approach.** A thorough assessment of the potential positive impact of each investment is crucial. This involves using a results measurement framework to understand the what, who, and how significant of the intended impact [3].
5.  **Assess, address, monitor, and manage potential negative impacts of each investment.** A comprehensive due diligence process should be in place to identify, avoid, and mitigate any potential negative social or environmental impacts of an investment [3].
6.  **Publicly disclose alignment with the Impact Principles and provide regular independent verification of the alignment.** Transparency is key. Investors should publicly disclose their alignment with impact principles and undergo regular independent verification to ensure accountability [3].

### 3. Key Practices

1.  **Intentionality:** Impact investors have a clear and stated intention to create positive social or environmental impact through their investments.
2.  **Impact Measurement and Management (IMM):** A robust IMM system is essential to track, measure, and report on the social and environmental performance of investments. This includes setting key performance indicators (KPIs) and regularly collecting data.
3.  **Contribution to Impact:** Investors actively seek to contribute to the impact of their investees, going beyond simply providing capital to offering strategic support, technical assistance, and access to networks.
4.  **Due Diligence with an Impact Lens:** The due diligence process incorporates a thorough assessment of the potential social and environmental risks and returns of an investment, alongside the financial analysis.
5.  **Stakeholder Engagement:** Impact investors engage with a wide range of stakeholders, including the communities affected by their investments, to ensure that their strategies are informed by and accountable to those they aim to benefit.
6.  **Exit Strategy with Sustained Impact:** The exit strategy is designed to ensure the long-term sustainability of the social or environmental impact created by the investment, even after the investor has exited.
7.  **Transparency and Reporting:** Impact investors are transparent about their impact performance, publishing regular reports that detail their progress towards their social and environmental goals.
8.  **Field Building:** Many impact investors actively contribute to the growth and development of the impact investing field by sharing best practices, participating in industry networks, and advocating for supportive policies.

### 4. Implementation

Implementing an impact investing strategy requires a thoughtful and systematic approach. The first step is to define the investor's impact thesis, which outlines the specific social or environmental goals they want to achieve and the theory of change for how their investments will contribute to those goals. This involves identifying the sectors, geographies, and types of organizations that align with the investor's mission. Once the impact thesis is established, the next step is to develop a pipeline of potential investments. This can be done through a variety of channels, including impact investing networks, accelerators, and direct outreach to social enterprises.

After identifying potential investments, a rigorous due diligence process is conducted to assess both the financial and impact potential of each opportunity. This includes a deep dive into the organization's business model, financial projections, leadership team, and its ability to generate and measure its intended impact. Once an investment is made, the investor actively manages it to support the organization in achieving its financial and impact goals. This can involve providing strategic guidance, connecting the organization with valuable resources, and helping them to strengthen their impact measurement and management systems. Finally, the investor plans for an exit that preserves the long-term impact of the investment.

Real-world examples of impact investing are abundant and diverse. For instance, Acumen, a non-profit global venture capital firm, has invested in companies like d.light, which provides affordable solar-powered lighting to off-grid communities, and Ziqitza Healthcare, which operates a network of affordable ambulance services in India. Another example is the Bridges Fund Management, which invests in businesses that are tackling some of the UK's most pressing social and environmental challenges, such as providing high-quality education in underserved areas and promoting sustainable living.
