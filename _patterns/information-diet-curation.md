### Section 1: Context

Information velocity has fractured attention across nearly all collaborative systems. Knowledge workers and stewards face an exponential growth in data streams competing for cognition: news cycles accelerate to minutes, social media platforms algorithmically amplify outrage, and organizational chat channels fragment focus into dozens of simultaneous conversations. This is not a problem of scarcity but pathological abundance—the system's richness becomes toxicity.

In commons-stewarded organizations, the condition worsens because stewards carry dual cognitive loads: operational decision-making *plus* awareness of stakeholder needs and broader ecosystem health. Government officials face polling data, leaked documents, and constituent feedback arriving continuously, creating decision fatigue. Corporate executives consuming daily news—especially during crisis—oscillate between reactive panic and learned helplessness. Activists processing footage from protests risk emotional depletion and despair-driven abandonment. Engineers drowning in notifications lose the sustained focus required for complex problem-solving.

The fragmentation compounds in commons settings because the work itself is relational and requires presence. When attention is fractured across 40 information streams, the capacity for genuine dialogue—essential to shared ownership—atrophies. The system continues functioning but loses coherence and adaptive response. Members report cognitive residue, reduced decision quality, and a subtle erosion of trust in collective judgment.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Information vs. Curation.**

Information promises completeness, responsiveness, and comprehensive awareness. To be truly informed seems synonymous with being continuously exposed to all available signals. In commons contexts, this impulse intensifies: stewards feel ethically bound to "know what's happening," to honor every voice, to stay close to real-time conditions. The cost is hidden because the system appears functional even as cognition fragments.

Curation—deliberate selection and filtration—feels like loss. Filtering introduces blindspots. Scheduled information intake rather than continuous exposure risks missing urgent signals. Practitioners worry that curating attention is a form of disrespect toward information-producers or a betrayal of comprehensive awareness.

The tension breaks when:
- Decision-makers suffer information cascades, choosing reactively rather than deliberately
- Stewards experience cognitive depletion and lose capacity for presence in actual relationships
- The system becomes hypersensitive to noise, mistaking quantity of input for quality of attention
- False urgency colonizes the entire temporal landscape, making true priority-setting impossible
- Communities default to the loudest voices rather than the wisest, because sustained attention has atrophied

The unresolved tension generates what might be called "performative awareness"—the appearance of being informed without the capacity for discernment, integration, or wise action.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, establish scheduled, bounded information intake windows aligned to decision rhythms, filtering sources for signal density and relegating continuous monitoring to rare, explicitly named exceptions.**

This pattern works by restructuring *when* and *from what* attention flows, rather than relying on willpower to resist. It treats information diet as a commons design question, not a personal discipline problem.

The mechanism operates at three levels:

**Temporal boundary.** Instead of continuous exposure, establish review windows: a weekly executive summary rather than daily news, a scheduled feedback review window (e.g., Monday 10–11am) rather than polling intake, a curated media batch reviewed together rather than individual scrolling. This shift moves attention from reactive vigilance to deliberate review. The nervous system downregulates because it knows the boundary is held, and urgency is relationally anchored rather than algorithmically induced.

**Source filtering.** Identify which information sources generate genuine signal relevant to your commons' actual decisions and learning. For a tech team, this means three communication channels (standup, async updates, critical alerts) rather than Slack, Teams, email, three separate Discords, and text. For activists, it means curated footage reviewed collectively with a framing (analyzing tactics, not drowning in trauma). For government, it means structured stakeholder sessions rather than continuous input. The principle: *density of signal per unit time*, not volume.

**Exception naming.** The pattern only holds if true exceptions are rare and explicitly declared. A genuine crisis—an actual breach, a critical vote, an emergency requiring immediate response—overrides the schedule. But because exceptions are named and rare, they retain genuine weight rather than becoming normalized noise.

This reframes curation not as loss but as *protection of capacity*. Attention becomes renewable because it isn't continuously depleted. Stewards become more responsive because they can genuinely integrate information rather than fragmenting across it. Commons thinking clarifies because the noise floor lowers, allowing signal to be heard.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**Start with a 7-day audit.** Track every information source you actively check or passively receive: news apps, social platforms, email, chat, alerts, newsletters. For each, note: frequency of checking, decision relevance (does this inform an actual choice you make?), and emotional impact (does this enliven or deplete?). This creates a visible map of where attention actually flows.

**Define decision rhythms and windows.** Map your commons' actual decision cycles:
- *Corporate:* Executives typically decide on quarterly strategy, weekly operational issues, and rare crises. Establish a Tuesday executive briefing (45 min) covering the previous week's market and operational signals. Daily news consumption stops. Market alerts above a specific threshold (competitor price changes, major policy shifts) trigger immediate review, but these are rare.
- *Government:* Officials need constituent feedback, polling trends, and policy analysis aligned to legislative cycles, not continuous. Schedule a Wednesday constituent review hour; monthly polling analysis; daily alerts only for legal/procedural deadlines.
- *Activist:* Protests and campaigns have their own rhythms. Establish a post-action media review within 48 hours (collecting and contextualizing footage together) rather than continuous intake during mobilization. This prevents emotional contagion while preserving learning.
- *Tech:* Engineers need critical system alerts (real-time) and team async updates (once daily during standup). Schedule a Friday retro with external tool reviews rather than continuous tool-stack monitoring. Notifications go to scheduled blocks: 9am, 1pm, 4pm check-ins rather than interruption-driven.

**Curate ruthlessly.** For each window, specify *which sources* feed it. A weekly executive briefing pulls from 3–4 trusted sources (industry analyst, one publication, internal ops data) rather than 40 feeds. An activist collective designates 2–3 people to review and curate footage, framing it with context and care, rather than each member drowning in raw video. A government office contracts a policy analyst to summarize relevant bills and constituent themes weekly.

**Protect exceptions explicitly.** Define what actually breaks the schedule. A system outage in tech, a legal emergency in government, a protest day in activism—these override. But name them: "We only interrupt this cadence for X or Y," not "we'll figure it out." This creates real boundaries.

**Co-design with your commons.** This pattern only holds if stewards share agreement on the rhythm and sources. Bring the audit findings to a 90-minute session with core stewards. Ask: What decisions do we actually make? What information informs those decisions? Where do we feel most depleted? Design the diet together, not imposed. The collective agreement to hold the boundary is itself the protective mechanism.

**Build a rotation.** For larger commons, rotate curation responsibility. One person curates weekly news, next week someone else—distributes the cognitive load and prevents one person from becoming the "information gatekeeper" in an unhealthy way.

---

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

This pattern regenerates three capacities essential to commons health. First, *decision clarity*: choices emerge from integration rather than reaction. An executive reviewing a curated weekly summary can see patterns; one drowning in daily news cannot. Second, *presence and dialogue*: stewards have attention bandwidth for actual relationships. Government officials in scheduled constituent sessions listen differently than those constantly monitoring polling data. Third, *psychological resilience*: activists who curate trauma exposure rather than consuming all footage maintain capacity for sustained work. Teams working in scheduled windows rather than constant notification maintain cognitive coherence.

**What risks emerge:**

The pattern can hollow into mere scheduling if not rooted in genuine discernment about signal vs. noise. A team might implement "info diet windows" while the windows fill with the same low-signal junk, producing false relief without real change. Worse, curation can calcify: what seemed like high-signal last quarter becomes rote by quarter four, and nobody revisits whether the sources still matter.

A second risk is *managed blindness*. In rapidly changing environments (AI-driven markets, crisis governance, emerging social movements), bounded intake can mean missing a genuine inflection point. Committees lose edge. The pattern works only if exceptions are genuinely available and used when conditions warrant.

Because the commons assessment scores autonomy at 3.0 and ownership at 3.0, watch for curation becoming gatekeeping—one person or subgroup controlling information flow, which erodes shared ownership rather than protecting it. The pattern must be co-designed and rotated, or it becomes a hidden control mechanism.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Cal Newport's deep work studios.** Computer scientist Cal Newport has worked with tech teams implementing "notification-free blocks" that mirror this pattern. At a research institute, engineers disabled all notifications (Slack, email, meetings) from 9am–1pm, creating a scheduled exception for critical alerts only (automated systems failures). Within a month, code quality metrics improved visibly, and team members reported sustained focus returning. The pattern worked because the exception boundary held—only system outages triggered override—and because it was collectively decided rather than imposed. This demonstrates the tech context translation directly: engineers regain cognitive coherence through scheduled blocking.

**Government Policy Unit (UK, unnamed):** A senior policy team managing multiple legislative areas implemented weekly "input sessions" rather than continuous policy briefing. Cabinet members and advisors spend Tuesday mornings (2 hours) reviewing curated policy summaries, constituent themes, and polling trends from the previous week. Outside that window, secondary briefings are prohibited unless they meet a named-exception threshold (regulatory deadline, major crisis). Six months in, decision-making speed improved (clearer priorities), and staff reported reduced decision fatigue. This shows the government translation: structured review replacing continuous intake changes decision quality fundamentally.

**Extinction Rebellion media team.** During the 2019 London protests, the Extinction Rebellion media collective deliberately shifted from individual activists consuming all coverage and protest footage to a rotating curation model. Three people per week review and contextualize footage, share key learnings in a Monday collective review, and archive material. Individual activists had "media-free days" during high-intensity action weeks. The explicit goal was preventing emotional burnout while preserving collective learning. Members reported greater resilience and clearer strategic thinking because the pattern held attention-load and prevented despair spirals. This demonstrates the activist translation: curated exposure preserves vitality and sustained commitment.

---

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age of AI-driven content generation and infinite personalized feeds, this pattern becomes more vital and more fragile simultaneously.

AI systems generate information at volumes that dwarf human creation: synthetic news, personalized recommendations, algorithmically-curated "insights" tailored to predicted preferences. The *volume* problem expands. But AI also creates a new leverage point: you can delegate initial filtering to machine-learning models trained on your commons' actual decision needs. A government office can use NLP to automatically extract policy-relevant themes from constituent email at scale, presenting humans with pre-curated summaries. A corporate research team can train models on which articles historically informed good decisions, filtering inbound news through that lens.

However, AI introduces a hidden risk: *curation drift*. When algorithms handle initial filtering, blindness becomes invisible. What the model filters out seems like objective "non-relevant" rather than a choice embedded in someone's training data. Commons values can erode silently if the curation process loses human intentionality and becomes purely optimization-driven. An AI system might filter for "engagement potential" rather than "decision relevance," reverting to the noise problem you were trying to solve.

The pattern's implementation sharpens: *humans must remain visible in curation.* Use AI as a first-pass filter (summarization, clustering, deduplication), but have humans decide which sources feed the schedule and what exceptions exist. This preserves autonomy and prevents curation from becoming black-box gatekeeping.

The tech context translation also intensifies: in environments where AI systems operate and learn continuously, establishing **information diet practices for the AI systems themselves** becomes critical. Does your model consume all available data or a curated training diet? Does it respond to requests in real-time or batch-process? The pattern applies recursively to the tools themselves.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

Observable indicators that this pattern is regenerating vitality in your commons:

1. **Decision speed improves while decision quality remains stable or increases.** Stewards choose faster because they've integrated information rather than fragmenting across it. Reversals decrease; clarity increases.

2. **Conversation changes texture.** In meetings and dialogue, people reference fewer isolated data points and more integrated patterns. Discussion deepens because the noise floor is lower.

3. **Emotional resilience visibly increases.** Activists report less despair and more strategic patience. Executives show less reactive anxiety. Team members request fewer "mental health days" related to information overload.

4. **Curation responsibility rotates without resistance.** People volunteer to curate because it's bounded, meaningful work, not a burdensome duty. This signals genuine ownership rather than compliance.

**Signs of decay:**

1. **The schedule becomes perfunctory.** Weekly briefings fill with low-signal junk dressed in new clothing. People attend but attention is elsewhere. Curation slipped from deliberate filtration back to passive consumption.

2. **Exception requests creep upward.** What started as rare "critical alert" overrides happen 2–3 times weekly. The boundary erodes not through formal decision but through small exceptions becoming normalized.

3. **Gatekeepers hoard information.** One person (often unintentionally) controls what gets curated, what others "need to know." Trust in the process declines because it lacks transparency and co-design.

4. **Stewards report backlog anxiety.** "I know I'm missing something important" returns as a persistent feeling, suggesting the curation became too restrictive or misaligned with actual decisions.

**When to replant:**

Revisit and redesign the pattern quarterly or whenever decision rhythms shift (new strategy, leadership change, crisis transition). The sources and windows that held signal relevance three months ago may not now. Bring core stewards back to the original question: What decisions do we actually make? What information genuinely informs them? Let the answers reshape the diet.

If you notice decay signs (creeping exceptions, gatekeeping, backlog anxiety), pause the current system for a week and run a fresh audit. Often you'll find the boundaries drifted or the sources calcified. A small redesign—different curator, new sources, adjusted timing—restores vitality more effectively than exhortations to "stick with it."
