# Problem Interviews

## Overview

Problem Interviews are a customer research technique focused on understanding customer problems, workflows, and pain points without pitching solutions. The methodology, popularized by Rob Fitzpatrick in his book 'The Mom Test,' provides a framework for entrepreneurs and product developers to have more effective and honest conversations with potential customers. The core idea is to avoid the common trap of seeking validation for a business idea, which often leads to misleading compliments and false positives. Instead, the focus is on discovering the underlying problems that customers face, how they currently solve them, and how significant those problems are in their lives. By focusing on the customer's life and their past experiences, rather than your idea, you can gather more reliable data to inform your product development and business strategy.

The 'Mom Test' metaphor highlights the challenge of getting honest feedback from people who care about you, like your mom. They are likely to be supportive and tell you your idea is great, even if they don't fully understand it or see its value. The same principle applies to conversations with potential customers who may want to be encouraging or avoid confrontation. Problem Interviews provide a set of rules and techniques to navigate these conversations and get to the truth. The goal is not to ask people if they like your idea, but to learn about their problems and see if your idea is a viable solution to a real-world need.

This pattern is particularly valuable in the early stages of a startup or new product development, when the risk of building something nobody wants is highest. By conducting effective Problem Interviews, you can de-risk your venture by validating the problem before you invest significant time and resources in building a solution. It's a fundamental practice for any team that wants to build a customer-centric product and increase their chances of success.

## Core Principles

1.  **Talk about their life instead of your idea.** The focus of the conversation should be on the customer's problems, needs, and experiences, not on your proposed solution. This helps to avoid biasing the conversation and encourages the customer to share honest and valuable insights.
2.  **Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future.** People are not good at predicting their own behavior. Instead of asking hypothetical questions like "Would you use this?", ask about specific instances in the past when they faced a similar problem. This provides more reliable data about their actual behavior and needs.
3.  **Talk less and listen more.** The goal of a Problem Interview is to learn from the customer, not to pitch your idea. You should be doing most of the listening and only talking to ask clarifying questions and guide the conversation. The more you talk, the less you learn.

## Key Practices

1.  **Avoid compliments, fluff, and ideas.** Compliments are worthless and misleading. Fluff, such as generic statements and hypothetical promises, is not actionable. Ideas from customers are often feature requests that don't address the root problem. Learn to identify and deflect these types of bad data.
2.  **Deflect compliments.** When you receive a compliment, don't take it as validation. Instead, deflect it and steer the conversation back to the customer's problems. For example, if they say "That's a great idea!", you can respond with "Thanks, but I'm more interested in hearing about how you currently solve this problem."
3.  **Anchor fluff to specifics.** When a customer uses generic terms like "I usually" or "I always," ask for a specific example. This helps to ground the conversation in reality and uncover the details of their experience.
4.  **Dig beneath ideas to find the root problem.** When a customer suggests a feature, don't just write it down. Ask them why they want that feature and what problem it would solve for them. This helps you to understand the underlying need and design a better solution.
5.  **Ask 'The 3 Big Questions'.** Before each conversation, prepare a list of the three most important things you want to learn. This helps to keep the conversation focused and ensures that you are asking the questions that matter most to your business.
6.  **Keep it casual.** Problem Interviews don't have to be formal meetings. You can have valuable conversations in a variety of settings, such as at a conference, in a coffee shop, or even online. The more casual the conversation, the more likely the customer is to be open and honest.

## Implementation

1.  **Preparation:**
    *   Define your goals for the interview. What do you want to learn?
    *   Identify your target customer segment.
    *   Prepare your list of 'The 3 Big Questions'.
    *   Have a plan for how you will take notes.

2.  **Finding People:**
    *   Leverage your personal and professional networks.
    *   Attend industry events and meetups.
    *   Use online platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter to find potential interviewees.
    *   Offer a small incentive, such as a gift card, to thank people for their time.

3.  **Conducting the Interview:**
    *   Start by building rapport and making the interviewee feel comfortable.
    *   Explain that you are doing research and not selling anything.
    *   Ask open-ended questions and let the interviewee do most of the talking.
    *   Use the 'Mom Test' principles to guide your questions.
    *   Take detailed notes, but don't let it distract you from the conversation.
    *   At the end of the interview, ask if they know anyone else you should talk to.

4.  **Analyzing the Results:**
    *   Review your notes and look for patterns and insights.
    *   Create a summary of your findings.
    *   Share your findings with your team and use them to inform your product development and business strategy.

## 7 Pillars Assessment

*   **Purpose (Score: 5):** Problem Interviews are deeply aligned with the purpose of creating value by ensuring that you are solving a real and meaningful problem for your customers. This practice helps to avoid wasting resources on building something that nobody wants.
*   **Governance (Score: 3):** While the practice itself is decentralized and can be performed by anyone on the team, it requires a certain level of coordination and a shared understanding of the principles to be effective. The team needs to agree on the goals of the research and how the findings will be used.
*   **Culture (Score: 5):** Problem Interviews foster a culture of humility, learning, and customer-centricity. It encourages the team to listen to customers and to be open to feedback, even when it is not what they want to hear.
*   **Incentives (Score: 4):** The primary incentive for conducting Problem Interviews is the increased likelihood of building a successful product. By understanding the customer's problems, you can create a solution that they are willing to pay for. This intrinsic reward is a powerful motivator.
*   **Knowledge (Score: 5):** This pattern is a powerful knowledge-generating process. It allows you to gather deep insights into your customers' needs, behaviors, and motivations. This knowledge is essential for making informed decisions about your product and business.
*   **Technology (Score: 3):** Problem Interviews are a low-tech practice that can be done with just a notebook and a pen. However, there are tools that can help with scheduling, note-taking, and analysis, which can make the process more efficient.
*   **Resilience (Score: 5):** By helping you to avoid building the wrong product, Problem Interviews significantly increase the resilience of your venture. It allows you to fail fast and cheap, and to pivot to a more promising direction before you have invested too much.

## When to Use

*   In the early stages of a startup or new product development.
*   When you are exploring a new market or customer segment.
*   Before you make a significant investment in product development.
*   When you want to validate or invalidate a business idea.
*   When you want to get a deeper understanding of your customers' needs.

## Anti-Patterns

*   **Pitching your solution:** The goal is to learn, not to sell.
*   **Asking hypothetical questions:** Focus on past behavior, not future intentions.
*   **Taking compliments as validation:** Compliments are not commitments.
*   **Talking more than listening:** You can't learn if you are doing all the talking.
*   **Not preparing for the interview:** You will waste your time and the interviewee's time.
*   **Interviewing friends and family without applying the 'Mom Test' principles:** They are likely to be biased.
