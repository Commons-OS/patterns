Identifying who actually holds influence and decision-making power in an organisation beyond the formal hierarchy — the hidden structure that governs what actually gets done.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Political Science / Organisational Behaviour.

### Section 1: Context

Most living organisations operate with a schism between their map and their territory. The org chart says one thing; the actual flow of decisions, resources, and trust moves through entirely different channels. In multi-generational systems — whether corporate hierarchies, public service bureaucracies, activist networks, or product teams — this gap widens with time. Older members accumulate relational capital invisible to newcomers. Trust networks calcify around particular people. Institutional knowledge lodges in specific nodes rather than distributed systems. The formal structure becomes increasingly decorative while informal structures grow their own roots deeper into the soil. This is not inherently pathological — informal networks can be the system's circulatory system, moving nutrients where rigid channels cannot. But when they operate wholly unexamined, they become bottlenecks, vulnerability points, and vectors for reproducing old power patterns. Teams fracture because they cannot see why certain decisions happen. Resources flow toward invisible gatekeepers. New members feel like they're navigating by braille. The commons begins to ossify precisely because the actual governance happens in shadows.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Informal vs. Mapping.**

Informal power abhors formal documentation. The moment you name it, you risk destabilising the delicate trust relationships that hold it together. A person's influence often derives precisely from their ability to move fluidly between groups, translate languages, broker deals — all activities that lose their potency the instant they become visible. Mapping, conversely, demands visibility. It requires naming who actually influences what decisions. It creates a record. It invites challenge.

The tension erupts into real organisational harm. When informal power remains unmapped, newcomers and minorities cannot access it — they follow the org chart and wonder why their brilliant ideas disappear into black holes. Decisions appear arbitrary because the actual decision-makers are invisible. Institutional knowledge concentrates in a few bodies; when those people leave or burn out, the organisation loses capacity catastrophically. Redundancy disappears. The system becomes fragile. Worse, unmapped informal power often reproduces historical inequities — the same people retain influence not because they have fresh ideas but because they were already inside the network. Meanwhile, formally designated leaders exhaust themselves trying to govern a system they cannot actually see.

The problem deepens when the informal structure actively contradicts the formal one. A director may have authority on paper while a long-serving coordinator holds actual decision-making power. This creates organisational shadow, where people perform obedience to invisible rules. Trust erodes. New members cannot figure out how to actually get things done.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, convene regular, bounded listening sessions where members name who actually influences which decisions, then surface and examine the patterns that emerge without demanding immediate restructuring.**

The mechanism works by creating a liminal space — formal enough to be taken seriously, informal enough that people can speak truthfully. You are not building a new hierarchy or dismantling the old one. You are making the actual system visible so it can be stewarded consciously rather than reproduced automatically.

This pattern shifts the organisation from unconscious reproduction to conscious design. In living systems language, it reveals the organism's actual nutrient pathways. You stop trying to feed the system through the official pipes and start tending the root network where real absorption happens. The mapping itself becomes a commons act: members collectively witness and name their own structure. This witnessing often generates the first real conversation about whether that structure still serves the system's values.

The solution works because it honors what Political Science tells us: informal power is real, necessary, and persistent. You cannot eliminate it by mandate. Organisations that try — that insist all influence flow through formal channels — become brittle and theatrical. Instead, you make the informal visible enough that it can be evaluated. Do the people who hold actual influence also hold formal accountability? Are they bottlenecks or vital connectors? Are they accessible to people outside their networks? Is their power being used to open doors or guard them?

The listening sessions themselves become a regenerative practice. They create ongoing occasions for members to see each other clearly. They name what everyone senses but cannot speak. And they create the ground for conscious choice: Do we want this power structure? If not, what would we change?

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**Prepare the container.**

Secure explicit buy-in from formal leadership — not because they need to approve informal power, but because this conversation works only if people feel genuinely safe. Brief them beforehand: this is not a threat to their authority; it is a tool for understanding why their authority sometimes does not translate into actual governance. Frame it as a learning initiative, not an audit. Set a clear, bounded time window — six weeks of monthly sessions, for example. This prevents the work from becoming a permanent investigation.

Design the listening protocol with care. Invite small groups (8–12 people) across role and tenure lines. In a **corporate** context, mix executives with individual contributors and support staff. In a **government** setting, bring together frontline workers, middle managers, and policy staff from different departments. For **activist** movements, cross-pollinate working groups so people meet those they rarely see. In a **tech** product context, include designers, engineers, and operations people in separate sessions, then cross-pollinate findings. The mixing itself is the data.

**Facilitate the naming.**

Ask one core question: "When important decisions get made in this organisation, who do people actually go to for influence?" Do not ask about formal authority; ask about actual influence. Follow with: "For what kinds of decisions? In what situations?" Push gently on specific instances: "Can you name a recent decision where someone's voice shaped the outcome even though they didn't have formal decision-making power?"

In the **corporate** context, you will often find that senior individual contributors or long-serving administrative staff hold enormous informal power. Name it. In **government**, watch for the informal networks that actually implement policy at street level — the social workers, inspectors, and frontline staff whose discretion shapes lived reality. In **activist** movements, the people holding informal power are often those with the deepest relational networks or longest continuity. In **tech**, map who actually shapes product direction — often not the official product leadership, but rather well-connected engineers or designers whose voice carries disproportionate weight in decision rooms.

**Document the patterns.**

After each listening session, create a simple map on a visible wall or shared document. Use circles for people, lines for influence flows. Thickness of lines indicates strength. Color-code by function or tenure. Do not name individuals; use roles ("Senior QA Tester," "Community Coordinator," "Frontline Case Manager"). The abstraction protects people while revealing structure.

Across all sessions, watch for: bottlenecks (single people through whom many decisions flow), silos (groups with no influence bridges between them), vacancies (formal leadership nodes with no actual influence), and bridges (people who translate between different parts of the system). These patterns often surprise formal leadership because they contradict the intended design.

**Bring findings to the collective.**

Host a whole-group session where you share the patterns you found — not the individuals, but the structural shapes. "We noticed that most decisions about resource allocation flow through three people, none of whom are on the resource committee." "We found that frontline staff have enormous influence on implementation but zero influence on policy direction." "We discovered that influence paths run almost entirely through tenure, with newer members systematically excluded from early-stage decisions."

Ask: Does this structure serve our values? Does it build resilience or create fragility? Does it distribute capacity or concentrate it? Is it accessible or exclusionary?

**Close with choice, not judgment.**

This is crucial. You are not here to shame informal power-holders or punish people for working outside official channels. You are here to ask: knowing what we now know, what do we want to change? Some organisations will decide their informal structure is actually more functional than the formal one and redesign the org chart to match. Others will decide they need to deliberately build more bridges and distribute influence more widely. Others will create explicit mentoring relationships to make informal knowledge accessible. The choice belongs to the collective.

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

New members and historically excluded people gain a map. They can now navigate deliberately rather than by accident. Formal leaders understand why their directives sometimes disappear without traction — they can now address the actual decision-making structure rather than fighting shadows. Trust increases because decisions cease to feel arbitrary. People understand why they are being asked to do things and who to actually approach when they need things. Resilience improves because knowledge and influence begin to distribute beyond individual bottlenecks; when a key person leaves, the organisation does not suddenly lose 40% of its capacity. Most importantly, the organisation develops conscious ownership of its own structure. Informal power becomes something the collective tends rather than something that happens to them.

**What risks emerge:**

The first risk is that naming becomes weaponisation. Someone discovers that their influence is lower than they believed, or that they are being used as a bottleneck. Resentment surfaces. This is real; you need skilled facilitation to hold it. The second risk is that this pattern can become routinised performance — a feel-good activity that documents the problem without creating sufficient friction to actually change it. Because this pattern sustains vitality through maintenance rather than generating new adaptive capacity (vitality score: 3.5), watch carefully for hollow repetition. If you map every quarter but nothing shifts, the mapping itself becomes a pacifier. The third risk is that formal leadership uses the mapping to consolidate power, eliminating informal gatekeepers without replacing them with distributed systems. Suddenly the informal network that held care and knowledge is gone, and nothing distributed replaces it. The resilience score of 3.0 reflects this: the pattern itself does not build robust alternatives.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**The New York Police Department and the 1970s reform era.** Political scientist James Q. Wilson documented what happened when NYPD leadership tried to understand why precinct commanders could ignore directives from central command. They mapped informal power and discovered that precinct captains held authority not through formal rank but through their relationships with patrol sergeants and long-serving desk officers. These informal nodes had been running the actual system for decades. Once visible, leadership could not simply purge them; instead, they built explicit mentoring programs to distribute the knowledge these informal leaders held. It did not eliminate informal power, but it made it generative rather than secretive.

**The UK's Department for Work and Pensions and benefit delivery.** When policymakers mapped how disability benefits actually got determined at street level, they discovered that decision-making had migrated almost entirely away from the formal assessment centers into informal networks between case managers, doctors, and advocacy organisations. These informal gatekeepers were applying standards that contradicted official policy. Once named, the department had to decide: were these informal networks actually delivering better justice than the formal system? (In many cases, yes.) Rather than fighting the informal structure, they eventually codified some of it, making discretionary judgment a formal part of the process instead of hidden.

**The Sierra Club's internal reorganisation (1990s).** As the environmental organisation grew multi-generational, tension erupted between its formal national governance structure and the informal networks of veteran activists who had held the organisation's culture for decades. When they mapped informal power, they discovered that crucial decisions about strategy were happening in hallway conversations and email threads among a handful of long-serving directors, while the official board meetings were ceremonial. This was suffocating newer members and preventing adaptive learning. They used the mapping to deliberately create explicit advisory roles for veteran activists, rotating decision-making responsibility, and building structured mentoring. Informal power did not disappear; it became integrated into formal governance.

**A mid-sized tech startup's engineering culture.** The CTO commissioned a power mapping exercise and discovered that three senior engineers — none of them official tech leads — controlled which features got prioritised, which design patterns persisted, and whose ideas gained traction in code review. These three had not seized power; the organisation had simply gravitated toward them because they were trusted. But their informal gatekeeping was preventing diversity in technical thinking and creating a single point of failure. The mapping led to explicit rotation of code review responsibility, structured design review processes, and deliberate onboarding of new voices into decision-making. The informal influencers became mentors and advisors rather than bottlenecks.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age of AI and networked intelligence, Informal Power Mapping faces both new hazards and new leverage. The tech context translation cuts deepest here: AI systems are being trained on decision-making patterns, and they will learn informal power structures even faster than humans do. An AI trained on your organisation's actual email flows, meeting recordings, and decision outcomes will map your informal power with surgical precision. This creates urgent risk: those informal power structures, once invisible to humans, become completely transparent to algorithmic systems. They can be optimised, predicted, and even manipulated at scale.

More insidiously, AI recommendation systems tend to amplify existing influence patterns. If your informal power structure privileges certain people, algorithms trained on past decisions will route more decisions toward those same people, entrenching informal hierarchies faster than human systems could. The composability score (4.5) becomes a liability; your informal structure can now be disaggregated, analyzed, and mechanically reproduced.

But there is leverage here too. AI tools can help perform Informal Power Mapping at speed and scale that would be impossible for humans alone. Natural language processing can track decision flows across email, chat, and documents. Network analysis can visualize influence patterns continuously rather than through episodic listening sessions. This creates the possibility of real-time, conscious governance of informal power rather than periodic discovery.

The new move is to deliberately map informal power *before* you deploy AI systems in your organisation. Understand your actual decision-making ecology before you hand the patterns to algorithms. Build explicit, human-stewarded governance of those patterns into your AI implementations. Do not let algorithms learn and perpetuate informal power unconsciously.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

Members from different tenures and roles can name the actual decision-makers and influence flows in their organisation. When a newcomer asks "how do things actually get decided," someone can give them a coherent map rather than a shrug. Formal leaders acknowledge that their org chart is incomplete and use the informal map alongside the official one. In meetings, when a decision is made, people understand not just *what* was decided but *why* — they can trace it back to the actual influence network. Most reliably: when an informally powerful person leaves the organisation, decision-making continues because their influence had been distributed or documented. Capacity persists rather than evaporating.

**Signs of decay:**

The mapping exercise becomes an annual ritual with no downstream consequences — it documents patterns without creating sufficient friction to change them. People speak the language of informal power in the listening sessions but revert to blaming the org chart afterward. Formal leaders acknowledge the mapping but do not adjust their expectations of how decisions actually happen. New people still cannot navigate effectively. The same bottlenecks persist year after year because the organisation names them but does not distribute the capacity they hold. Worst sign: the mapping becomes a tool for formal leadership to identify and eliminate informal power-holders rather than tend them, destroying knowledge and relationship networks without replacing them.

**When to replant:**

Restart this practice when you notice either of two conditions: (1) you are experiencing cascading failures because key people are burning out or leaving, signaling that informal power has concentrated unsustainably, or (2) new members consistently fail to integrate despite good onboarding, signaling that informal networks have become exclusive rather than navigable. The right moment is when the cost of invisibility exceeds the discomfort of seeing.
