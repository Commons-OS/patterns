# Transferable: Applicable Beyond Single Organization

## 1. Overview

A transferable organizational pattern is a blueprint for organizing people and resources that can be successfully applied across different organizations, industries, and cultures. These patterns are not tied to a specific company's context but instead represent universal principles of effective organization. The 'Transferable' quality of a pattern is a testament to its robustness and its foundation in fundamental truths about human collaboration and value creation. Unlike idiosyncratic practices that are deeply embedded in a single company's culture and history, transferable patterns can be extracted, adapted, and implemented in new environments to achieve similar results. This makes them powerful tools for organizational design and transformation, enabling companies to learn from the successes of others and to build upon a collective body of knowledge about what makes organizations thrive.

The concept of transferability is closely linked to the idea of 'best practices,' but with a crucial distinction. While best practices are often specific techniques or processes, transferable patterns are higher-level principles that can be instantiated in many different ways. For example, the 'Agile' methodology is a transferable pattern for software development that has been successfully adapted for use in a wide range of other industries, from manufacturing to marketing. The core principles of Agile, such as iterative development, cross-functional teams, and customer collaboration, are transferable, even though the specific practices used to implement them may vary from one organization to another. The ability to recognize and apply these transferable patterns is a key capability for leaders and organizational designers in the 21st century, as it allows them to build more resilient, adaptive, and effective organizations.

## 2. Core Principles

The transferability of an organizational pattern is rooted in a set of core principles that allow it to be lifted from one context and successfully applied in another. These principles are the 'genetic code' of the pattern, the essential elements that must be preserved for it to retain its integrity and effectiveness. While the specific implementation of a pattern may vary, these core principles are non-negotiable.

**1. Modularity:** Transferable patterns are modular, meaning they can be understood and implemented as discrete units. This modularity allows them to be combined with other patterns to create more complex organizational designs, and it also makes them easier to pilot and test in a small part of an organization before being rolled out more broadly. A modular pattern has clear boundaries and interfaces, which makes it easier to integrate with existing organizational structures and processes.

**2. Scalability:** A key feature of a transferable pattern is its ability to scale. This means it can be applied to teams, departments, and entire organizations of different sizes without losing its effectiveness. A scalable pattern is not dependent on a specific number of people or a particular level of resources. For example, the principle of 'decentralized decision-making' can be applied to a small startup or a large multinational corporation, although the specific mechanisms for achieving it may differ.

**3. Adaptability:** Transferable patterns are not rigid templates but flexible frameworks that can be adapted to the specific needs and context of an organization. They provide a set of guiding principles and constraints, but they also leave room for local interpretation and customization. This adaptability is crucial for ensuring that the pattern is a good fit for the organization's culture, strategy, and environment.

**4. Abstraction:** Transferable patterns are expressed at a certain level of abstraction, which allows them to be applied to a wide range of situations. They are not overly prescriptive about the specific tools or techniques to be used, but instead focus on the underlying principles and relationships. This abstraction is what makes it possible to see the commonalities between seemingly different organizational challenges and to apply the same underlying pattern to solve them.

**5. Empirical Validation:** The most robust transferable patterns are those that have been empirically validated in a variety of contexts. This means there is evidence to suggest that they are effective at achieving their intended outcomes. This evidence may come from academic research, case studies, or the collective experience of a community of practice. The more a pattern has been tested and proven in the real world, the more confident an organization can be in its decision to adopt it.

## 3. Key Practices

While the core principles of a transferable pattern are abstract, they are made concrete through a set of key practices. These practices are the specific activities and behaviors that bring the pattern to life within an organization. They are the bridge between the high-level principles and the day-to-day work of the people in the organization. The following are some of the key practices that are essential for successfully implementing transferable organizational patterns.

**1. Pattern Identification and Selection:** The first step in using transferable patterns is to identify and select the ones that are most relevant to the organization's needs. This requires a deep understanding of the organization's strategy, challenges, and context. It also requires a knowledge of the available patterns and their potential benefits and drawbacks. This practice often involves a process of research, analysis, and dialogue among the organization's leaders and stakeholders.

**2. Contextualization and Adaptation:** Once a pattern has been selected, it must be contextualized and adapted to the specific needs of the organization. This is not a one-size-fits-all process. It requires a careful consideration of the organization's culture, structure, and processes. The goal is to find the right balance between fidelity to the core principles of the pattern and adaptation to the local context. This practice often involves a process of experimentation and learning, as the organization discovers what works and what doesn't in its own environment.

**3. Pilot Testing and Iteration:** Before rolling out a new pattern across the entire organization, it is often wise to pilot test it in a smaller, more controlled setting. This allows the organization to learn about the pattern's effects and to make any necessary adjustments before a full-scale implementation. This practice of pilot testing and iteration is a key part of the learning process, and it helps to reduce the risks associated with organizational change.

**4. Measurement and Evaluation:** To know whether a transferable pattern is working, it is essential to measure and evaluate its impact. This requires a clear set of metrics that are aligned with the organization's goals. These metrics might include measures of financial performance, customer satisfaction, employee engagement, or operational efficiency. The practice of measurement and evaluation provides the feedback that is necessary for continuous improvement.

**5. Knowledge Sharing and Community of Practice:** The use of transferable patterns is often enhanced by the existence of a community of practice. This is a group of people who share a common interest in the pattern and who come together to learn from each other's experiences. A community of practice can be a valuable source of knowledge, support, and inspiration. It can also play a key role in the ongoing evolution and refinement of the pattern itself.

## 4. Application Context

Transferable organizational patterns can be applied in a wide variety of contexts, but they are particularly valuable in situations where an organization is facing a significant challenge or opportunity. The following are some of the application contexts where transferable patterns can be especially useful.

**1. Startups and New Ventures:** Startups and new ventures are often in a state of rapid growth and change. They need to be able to adapt quickly to new opportunities and challenges. Transferable patterns can provide a set of proven building blocks for creating a scalable and resilient organization. For example, a startup might use the 'Lean Startup' pattern to guide its product development process, or the 'Holacracy' pattern to structure its organization.

**2. Organizational Transformation:** When an organization is undergoing a major transformation, such as a shift in its business model or a merger with another company, transferable patterns can provide a roadmap for the change process. They can help to ensure that the new organization is designed in a way that is aligned with its strategy and that it is able to achieve its goals. For example, a company that is transitioning from a product-centric to a customer-centric business model might use the 'Customer Journey Mapping' pattern to redesign its processes.

**3. Cross-Functional Collaboration:** In today's complex and interconnected world, cross-functional collaboration is more important than ever. Transferable patterns can provide a common language and a set of shared practices for teams that are working across organizational boundaries. For example, a company might use the 'Agile' pattern to manage a complex project that involves people from multiple departments.

**4. Scaling and Growth:** As an organization grows, it often faces new challenges related to coordination, communication, and decision-making. Transferable patterns can help an organization to scale its operations without losing its agility or its focus on the customer. For example, a company that is expanding into new markets might use the 'Franchise' pattern to replicate its business model in different locations.

**5. Knowledge Management:** In a knowledge-based economy, the ability to create, share, and apply knowledge is a key source of competitive advantage. Transferable patterns can provide a framework for managing knowledge within an organization. For example, a company might use the 'Community of Practice' pattern to foster learning and collaboration among its employees.

## 5. Implementation

Implementing a transferable organizational pattern is a significant undertaking that requires careful planning and execution. It is not simply a matter of copying what another organization has done. Rather, it is a process of creative adaptation, in which the core principles of the pattern are tailored to the specific context of the organization. The following are the key stages in the implementation process.

**1. Building the Case for Change:** The first stage in the implementation process is to build a compelling case for change. This involves articulating the problem that the organization is trying to solve and showing how the proposed pattern can help to address it. This case for change needs to be communicated to all of the key stakeholders, including senior leaders, middle managers, and frontline employees. The goal is to create a shared sense of urgency and a common understanding of the need for change.

**2. Assembling the Implementation Team:** The implementation of a new organizational pattern should be led by a dedicated team of individuals who have the skills, knowledge, and authority to make it happen. This team should be cross-functional, with representatives from all of the key parts of the organization. It should also have a clear mandate and the full support of the senior leadership team.

**3. Developing the Implementation Plan:** The implementation team is responsible for developing a detailed plan for how the new pattern will be rolled out across the organization. This plan should include a clear timeline, a set of milestones, and a budget. It should also specify the roles and responsibilities of all of the individuals who will be involved in the implementation process.

**4. Communicating and Training:** The successful implementation of a new organizational pattern depends on effective communication and training. All of the employees who will be affected by the change need to understand what is happening, why it is happening, and what is expected of them. They also need to be given the training and support that they need to be successful in the new environment.

**5. Monitoring and Adjusting:** The implementation of a new organizational pattern is not a one-time event. It is an ongoing process of monitoring, learning, and adjusting. The implementation team needs to track the progress of the implementation, identify any problems or challenges, and make any necessary adjustments to the plan. This process of continuous improvement is essential for ensuring that the new pattern is sustainable over the long term.

## 6. Evidence & Impact

The evidence for the effectiveness of transferable organizational patterns comes from a variety of sources, including academic research, case studies, and the practical experience of organizations around the world. While it is difficult to quantify the precise impact of any single pattern, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that they can have a significant and positive impact on organizational performance.

**1. Improved Financial Performance:** Many organizations that have successfully implemented transferable patterns have reported significant improvements in their financial performance. For example, a study by McKinsey found that companies that are more agile are more likely to have higher profits. This is because transferable patterns can help organizations to reduce costs, increase revenues, and improve their overall efficiency.

**2. Enhanced Customer Satisfaction:** Transferable patterns can also have a positive impact on customer satisfaction. This is because they can help organizations to become more responsive to the needs of their customers and to deliver a better overall customer experience. For example, a company that uses the 'Customer Journey Mapping' pattern is more likely to design products and services that meet the needs of its customers.

**3. Increased Employee Engagement:** When employees are empowered to make decisions and to take ownership of their work, they are more likely to be engaged and motivated. Transferable patterns can help to create a more engaging and empowering work environment. For example, a company that uses the 'Holacracy' pattern is more likely to have employees who are committed to the organization's goals.

**4. Greater Agility and Adaptability:** In today's rapidly changing world, the ability to adapt to new challenges and opportunities is more important than ever. Transferable patterns can help organizations to become more agile and adaptable. This is because they provide a set of flexible and scalable building blocks that can be reconfigured as needed. For example, a company that uses the 'Agile' pattern is more likely to be able to respond quickly to changes in the market.

**5. Increased Innovation:** Transferable patterns can also help to foster a culture of innovation. This is because they can create an environment in which new ideas are encouraged and in which employees are empowered to experiment and to take risks. For example, a company that uses the 'Lean Startup' pattern is more likely to develop innovative new products and services.

## 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

The Cognitive Era, characterized by the rise of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data, is having a profound impact on the world of work. In this new era, the ability to learn, adapt, and innovate is more important than ever. Transferable organizational patterns are particularly well-suited to the challenges and opportunities of the Cognitive Era, as they provide a framework for building more intelligent and adaptive organizations.

**1. Human-Machine Collaboration:** In the Cognitive Era, we are likely to see an increase in human-machine collaboration. Transferable patterns can help to structure this collaboration in a way that is both effective and ethical. For example, the 'Centaur' pattern, in which humans and machines work together as a team, can be used to design new workflows that leverage the strengths of both.

**2. Data-Driven Decision-Making:** The Cognitive Era is also characterized by the availability of vast amounts of data. Transferable patterns can help organizations to make better use of this data by providing a framework for data-driven decision-making. For example, the 'A/B Testing' pattern can be used to experiment with different approaches and to learn what works best.

**3. Continuous Learning and Adaptation:** In a rapidly changing world, the ability to learn and adapt is essential for survival. Transferable patterns can help organizations to become more learning-oriented by providing a framework for continuous improvement. For example, the 'After Action Review' pattern can be used to reflect on past experiences and to identify lessons for the future.

**4. The Future of Work:** The Cognitive Era is also likely to have a significant impact on the future of work. As routine tasks are automated, there will be a greater demand for skills such as creativity, critical thinking, and collaboration. Transferable patterns can help organizations to prepare for the future of work by creating a more human-centered and engaging work environment.

## 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

The Commons Alignment Assessment is a tool for evaluating the extent to which an organizational pattern is aligned with the principles of the commons. The commons is a paradigm for managing resources that is based on the principles of collaboration, sharing, and sustainability. The following is an assessment of the 'Transferable' pattern against the seven dimensions of the commons.

**1. Openness and Transparency (4/5):** Transferable patterns are generally open and transparent. They are often documented in publicly available resources, such as books, articles, and websites. This makes it easy for organizations to learn about them and to adopt them. However, some patterns may be proprietary or may be protected by intellectual property rights, which can limit their openness.

**2. Participation and Collaboration (5/5):** Transferable patterns are highly participatory and collaborative. They are often developed and refined by a community of practice, and they are designed to be adapted and customized by the organizations that use them. This encourages a culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing.

**3. Decentralization and Distribution (5/5):** Transferable patterns are inherently decentralized and distributed. They are not controlled by any single organization, and they can be implemented in a variety of different ways. This makes them resilient and adaptable to a wide range of contexts.

**4. Sustainability and Resilience (4/5):** Transferable patterns can contribute to the sustainability and resilience of an organization. This is because they can help an organization to become more agile, adaptable, and innovative. However, the sustainability of a pattern also depends on the specific context in which it is implemented.

**5. Equity and Inclusion (3/5):** The extent to which a transferable pattern promotes equity and inclusion depends on how it is implemented. Some patterns, such as 'Holacracy,' are designed to distribute power more evenly, while others may not have a specific focus on equity and inclusion. It is important to consider the potential impact of a pattern on all of the members of an organization, and to take steps to ensure that it is implemented in a way that is fair and equitable.

**6. Purpose and Values (4/5):** Transferable patterns are often associated with a particular set of values, such as collaboration, transparency, and empowerment. When an organization adopts a transferable pattern, it is also adopting these values. This can help to create a more purpose-driven and values-aligned organization.

**7. Governance and Accountability (4/5):** Transferable patterns can provide a framework for governance and accountability. For example, the 'Sociocracy' pattern provides a set of principles and practices for decision-making and governance. However, the effectiveness of a pattern's governance model depends on the specific context in which it is implemented.

**Overall Commons Alignment Score: 4/5**
