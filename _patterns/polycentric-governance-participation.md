Contributing effectively within governance structures that have multiple, overlapping decision centres — learning when to act locally, when to coordinate across centres, and when to escalate to system-level governance.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Ostrom / Polycentric Governance.

---

### Section 1: Context

Mature commons and collaborative organizations fragment naturally as they grow. A startup governance circle works fine at 8 people; at 80, it becomes a bottleneck or a stage for the loudest voices. Real systems evolve multiple decision-making nodes: regional teams, product squads, working groups, thematic councils, communities of practice. These nodes overlap. A decision made in the product layer affects the activist movement. A budget choice in one geographic region cascades to three others. The system is neither fully centralized nor fully decentralized — it is polycentric. The living challenge is learning to *participate* effectively across these nested, overlapping centres without either collapsing into a single point of authority or shattering into isolated fiefdoms. The system is neither fragile nor vital; it is functional but at risk of calcification. Ostrom's empirical work on commons governance showed that this structure — multiple decision-making centres with clear jurisdictions, overlapping authority, and nested layers — is precisely what enables long-lived, resilient systems. But the pattern only works if people know *how* to move through it.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Polycentric vs. Participation.**

Polycentric systems distribute power. That's their strength. But distributed power creates a maze. A contributor or steward faces a constant question: *Where does this decision belong?* Should I raise this issue in my local working group, or does it need the regional council? Should I act unilaterally, or is this a cross-domain choice that requires coordination? The polycentric pull says: "Keep authority local. Minimize escalation. Let each centre govern its own domain." The participation pull says: "I want to influence outcomes that affect me. I want visibility. I want to be heard." These desires collide. Local autonomy breeds information silos — decisions cascade invisibly, and people who should have been consulted find out afterward. Premature escalation paralyzes the system; everything becomes a slow, consensus-building mess. People either disengage (cynicism rises, vitality decays) or they create shadow decision-making networks (trust erodes). Meanwhile, the system lacks a shared map of jurisdiction. One person thinks the budget decision lives in the regional centre; another believes it belongs system-wide. Coordination fails not from malice but from confusion about *where power actually lives*. Without a living practice of polycentric participation, the system fragments or ossifies.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, establish and continuously renew a shared map of decision domains, then cultivate the reflective discipline to match each contribution to the right decision centre, with explicit escalation pathways for decisions that cross boundaries.**

This pattern works by making the invisible visible. Most polycentric systems have implicit jurisdictions; people learn through experience and rumor. The solution is to *name the decision centres explicitly* and *describe what each one decides*. This is not a org chart — it is a living ecology map. It shows which centres hold authority over what, which centres must coordinate, and crucially, *how a decision moves* when it crosses a boundary.

The second move is cultivation of reflective practice. Before acting, a steward pauses: *Does this decision belong to my local centre, or does it ripple outward?* This pause is the root system of effective participation. It prevents both premature escalation and invisible local decisions. It builds a shared culture of accountability.

The third move is creating explicit escalation pathways. Not "escalate when you feel like it," but *structured gateways*: "If a decision affects three or more regions, it goes to the regional council. If it affects the system's core values, it goes to the steering circle." These pathways become roots that hold the system together. They prevent decisions from vanishing into ambiguity.

Over time, this pattern seeds a new capacity: *polycentric literacy*. Participants develop an intuitive sense of jurisdiction. They navigate the system without friction. Trust grows because decisions happen transparently and in the right place. Autonomy strengthens because local centres know their domain is protected. Coordination happens cleanly because cross-boundary decisions are visible and deliberate.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**1. Map your actual decision centres.** Gather the stewards who navigate your system daily. For each major decision area (budget, hiring, product direction, community standards, resource allocation), ask: *Who actually decides this?* Not who should decide — who does. You will likely find formal centres (a board, a council) and informal ones (a key person, an implicit group). Write them down. Name them. This is your first map. It is imperfect and alive.

**Corporate callout:** In organizations, map the formal hierarchy alongside actual influence. Your exec team is one centre; so is the engineering cabal, the customer advisory board, the long-term staff network. Name them all. Then clarify: does the CFO's budget decision include or exclude the regional office heads? Does it require consent or consultation?

**Government callout:** Public services often have statutory decision centres (cabinet, council, regulatory body) alongside practice-based ones (street-level staff, community advisory groups, inter-agency task forces). Map both. Then name the escalation rule: when does a street-level decision ripple to cabinet level?

**2. Create explicit jurisdictional boundaries.** For each centre, write: "This centre decides [X, Y, Z]. It consults [these other centres]. It escalates to [this centre] when [these conditions]." Make it specific. Bad example: "The team decides on team matters." Good example: "The product team decides on sprint priorities, technical approach, and resource allocation within the team budget. It consults with regional centres when a decision affects their user base. It escalates pricing changes to the commercial council."

**Activist callout:** Movements fragment because jurisdiction is invisible. Write: "The local action group decides on tactics and timing for their region. They consult the communications centre before external messaging. They escalate decisions about inter-movement partnerships to the steering circle." Activists can then act with confidence.

**Tech callout:** For products, map: "The product council decides on roadmap direction. Squad leads decide on implementation within sprint. The data council decides on analytics and privacy. They escalate when a feature touches three or more user segments." This prevents both squad silos and design-by-committee.

**3. Establish escalation pathways, not escalation panic.** Write the rules clearly: "A decision escalates if: (a) it affects more than [X] centres, or (b) it contradicts a previous system-level decision, or (c) it commits resources beyond [Y] threshold, or (d) it touches core values." Make these rules visible. Train people on them. The goal is not fewer escalations — it is *right-sized* escalations.

**4. Run quarterly "jurisdiction refresh" sessions.** Gather stewards. Ask: *Where were we confused about who decides?* Where did decisions happen invisibly? Where did things get stuck? Update the map. This is not a reorg — it is tending the root system. The map decays without this attention.

**5. Create a decision log.** For each significant decision, record: Where was it made? Who was consulted? Who was affected? Did it escalate? This log becomes a living case law of your polycentric system. New people learn from it. You spot patterns (decisions that keep escalating, centres that go silent, coordination breakdowns).

**6. Teach the pause.** When a steward brings a decision forward, the culture asks: *Is this in the right place?* Not as blame, but as care. "Let's check the map together. Does this belong here, or should we bring in the regional council first?" This becomes normal. The pause takes 90 seconds and prevents weeks of rework.

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

Trust deepens because decisions happen transparently and predictably. People know where their influence lives and where they need to coordinate. Local autonomy strengthens — regional teams or product squads can move fast because they know their domain is protected. Cross-domain coordination becomes cleaner because escalation pathways are explicit; decisions don't vanish into shadow networks. A new form of literacy emerges: people develop an intuitive sense of jurisdiction. Onboarding becomes simpler because the map is written, not tribal knowledge. The system becomes more resilient to personnel changes because decision-making doesn't collapse when a key person leaves.

**What risks emerge:**

The map can ossify into rigid hierarchy if stewards stop renewing it. Rules become dogma. "This always goes to the regional council" replaces the living question "Does this need coordination?" Bureaucracy grows without adding vitality. The commons assessment notes autonomy scores at 3.0 — lower than other dimensions. This suggests polycentric systems can inadvertently constrain individual initiative through over-governance. Stewards may spend energy navigating jurisdiction rather than creating value. If escalation pathways are unclear or frequently disputed, the system fragments anyway — people stop trusting the map and create shadow decision-making. Finally, the pattern sustains vitality without necessarily generating new adaptive capacity. Watch for signs of rigidity: decisions that take longer, declining participation in governance, a sense that "nothing can move without consensus."

### Section 6: Known Uses

**The Irrigation Communities of Spain (Ostrom's original case).** The Huertas de Levante, dating from the 11th century, managed water distribution across overlapping irrigation zones. Each zone (acequia) had its own decision-making council — jurisdiction over water timing and maintenance within that zone. A cross-zone water allocation council (the *tribunal*) met quarterly to resolve boundary issues and escalate rare system-wide conflicts. Each council member understood: *Where does my decision live?* Local councils could innovate rapidly. Cross-zone escalations were visible and few. The system sustained itself for over 900 years. The pattern: explicit jurisdictions, clear escalation (quarterly tribunal meeting), local autonomy within defined boundaries.

**The Platform Cooperative Movement (Activist translation).** Stocksy, a photographer-owned stock photography platform, operates through nested councils: local photographer groups (decide on image curation and licensing within their region), the creative council (sets platform-wide aesthetic direction), the commercial council (sets pricing), and the member assembly (decides constitutional changes). A photographer in Toronto knows: she influences local curation instantly; she can propose licensing changes to the creative council quarterly; constitutional changes require the full assembly. Decision velocity is high locally, consensus-based globally. Participation is high because stewards know where their voice matters most.

**The Mozilla Firefox Browser Governance (Tech translation).** Mozilla coordinates through overlapping centres: the Rust community (decides language design), the Firefox product council (decides browser roadmap), regional localization teams (decide translations and regional market strategy), and the Mozilla Foundation (holds constitutional authority). A developer contributing to Rust knows their decision authority clearly. Cross-domain decisions (e.g., a new feature that affects localization) surface to the product council with defined consultation pathways. This structure has allowed Firefox to navigate massive product pivots while maintaining contributor morale and coordination across 100+ language communities.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

Polycentric governance was born in a world where information moved slowly and decision centres were geographically separated. AI and distributed intelligence change the terrain fundamentally.

First, *decision centres proliferate*. Autonomous systems (recommendation engines, moderation bots, data pipelines) now make consequential choices. A practitioner must ask: *Is the recommendation algorithm a decision centre? Does its output escalate to human governance?* The pattern must expand to include non-human actors. The map must be explicit about which decisions are automated and which are escalation triggers.

Second, *coordination becomes cheaper*. AI-powered decision logging, cross-domain impact analysis, and real-time stakeholder mapping make invisible ripple effects visible instantly. A change in one product feature can be traced to affected user segments in seconds. This could accelerate right-sized escalation — decisions reach the right centre faster. Or it could create decision paralysis: so much visibility that every choice feels system-level.

Third, *the tech context translation becomes critical*. Product platforms with ML-driven personalization are inherently polycentric: the recommendation system, the content council, the user safety team, the commercial team all make overlapping decisions. Without explicit jurisdiction mapping, the system becomes an opaque tangle. With it, you can explain why a user sees what they see.

Fourth, *new failure modes emerge*. Automated decision centres can accumulate authority silently. A recommendation algorithm that shapes 70% of user experience may be governed loosely, while human teams argue about the other 30%. Escalation pathways designed for human deliberation may be too slow for real-time algorithmic adjustments. The pattern must be renewed to govern the speed and opacity of machine intelligence.

The leverage: *AI enables real-time jurisdiction mapping*. Systems can show decision traces, flag cross-boundary impacts before they happen, and recommend escalation. The pattern becomes not slower but more transparent.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

1. Stewards routinely pause before acting to ask "Is this the right centre?" without prompting. The question becomes cultural reflex, not compliance burden.

2. Escalation happens cleanly and on schedule. When a decision crosses boundaries, it surfaces quickly to the right centre with context already prepared. No bottlenecks; no surprises.

3. The decision log shows patterns. Over a quarter, you can see which decisions stayed local (fast, autonomy-high) and which escalated (coordinated, integrated). The distribution tells you the system is balanced.

4. New people onboard faster. They learn the map, not tribal knowledge. They navigate the system within weeks, not months.

**Signs of decay:**

1. The map is outdated or ignored. "We have a decision framework, but nobody uses it. People just go to whoever yells loudest." Jurisdiction is invisible again.

2. Escalation becomes a pressure relief valve. Everything goes up because no one trusts local authority. Or nothing escalates because people have given up on coordination.

3. Shadow networks form. Stewards coordinate outside the official system because the official pathways feel slow or irrelevant. Trust in the map erodes.

4. Participation in governance drops noticeably. Fewer people attend councils. Fewer proposals surface. The system runs on inertia, not vitality.

**When to replant:**

Restart the mapping practice when three of these decay signs appear simultaneously or when a significant personnel change happens (new leader, major team reorganization). The moment to redesign is when your system faces a decision it has never had to make before — a scale shift, a new domain, a crisis. That is when the old map breaks and reveals its limits. Gather the stewards, revisit the jurisdictional questions, and grow a new root system that fits the new terrain.
