# French Dirigisme

## 1. Overview

French Dirigisme is an economic framework where the state plays a highly influential and directive role in the nation's economy. This approach, which gained prominence in the post-World War II era, is characterized by a strong partnership between the government and private industry, with the state guiding investment, fostering national champions, and using indicative planning to steer economic development. While not a centrally planned economy, Dirigisme represents a significant departure from laissez-faire capitalism, emphasizing state intervention to correct market failures, promote strategic industries, and ensure long-term economic stability and growth. [1] [2]

## 2. Core Principles

The core principles of French Dirigisme are rooted in the belief that the state has a vital and proactive role to play in guiding economic development. These principles, which distinguish Dirigisme from both laissez-faire capitalism and centrally planned economies, include the state as a strategic actor, pragmatic interventionism, public-private partnership, and the promotion of national champions. The state is not merely a regulator but an active participant in the economy, setting long-term goals and directing investment to achieve them. This involves a strategic vision for the nation's economic future, with the government identifying key industries and sectors for development. Dirigisme is characterized by a pragmatic approach to market intervention. The state intervenes to correct perceived market failures, to nurture infant industries, and to ensure that economic activities align with national interests. This intervention is not based on a rigid ideology but on a practical assessment of what is needed to achieve economic objectives. The framework is built on a close collaboration between the state and private enterprise. The government works with businesses to guide their investment decisions, providing them with incentives, financial support, and a stable environment for growth. This partnership is intended to be mutually beneficial, with the state helping businesses to become more competitive and businesses contributing to the nation's economic development. A key element of Dirigisme is the promotion of "national champions" – large, state-supported companies that are expected to compete on the global stage. These companies, often in strategic sectors like aerospace, energy, and transportation, benefit from preferential treatment and are seen as instruments of national economic power. [1] [2]

## 3. Key Practices

French Dirigisme is implemented through a set of distinctive practices that translate its core principles into action. These practices include indicative planning, state ownership and control, control over credit, and technocratic governance. Indicative planning is the cornerstone of Dirigisme. The government, through institutions like the *Commissariat général du Plan*, creates multi-year plans that outline the country's economic priorities and investment targets. These plans are not legally binding but serve as a powerful signal to both public and private actors, guiding their decisions and coordinating their activities. The state maintains significant ownership stakes in key industries, either directly or through state-owned enterprises. This allows the government to exert direct control over strategic sectors of the economy, ensuring that they operate in the national interest. The state exercises considerable influence over the financial system, directing credit to favored industries and companies. This is a powerful tool for steering investment and promoting the development of strategic sectors. The implementation of Dirigisme is entrusted to a cadre of elite civil servants, or "technocrats," who are trained in prestigious institutions like the École Nationale d'Administration (ENA). These technocrats, who often move between high-level positions in government and industry, play a crucial role in formulating and executing economic policy. [2] [4]

## 4. Application Context

French Dirigisme emerged in the specific historical and economic context of post-World War II France. The country was devastated by the war, with its infrastructure and industrial base in ruins. There was a strong political consensus that a new approach to economic management was needed to rebuild the country and to ensure its future prosperity and security. The pre-war economic model, characterized by a fragmented and often inefficient private sector, was seen as inadequate to the task of reconstruction. This created a fertile ground for a more interventionist approach, with the state taking a leading role in a national effort to modernize the economy. The Cold War also played a significant role in the adoption of Dirigisme. The desire to maintain national independence and to build a strong industrial base as a bulwark against both American and Soviet influence was a powerful motivator. Dirigisme was seen as a "third way" between the perceived excesses of American-style capitalism and the rigidities of Soviet-style communism. [1] [5]

## 5. Implementation

The implementation of French Dirigisme was a complex and multifaceted process, involving a range of institutions and policy instruments. At the heart of the system was the *Commissariat général du Plan* (General Planning Commission), which was established in 1946. The Plan, as it was known, was responsible for drawing up a series of multi-year indicative plans that set out the government's economic objectives and investment priorities. These plans were developed through a process of consultation and consensus-building, involving representatives from government, industry, and trade unions. While the plans were not legally binding, they had a powerful influence on the allocation of resources. The state used a variety of levers to encourage compliance with the plan, including financial incentives, state procurement, and price controls. The government provided a range of financial incentives to companies that invested in priority sectors, including low-interest loans, tax breaks, and subsidies. The state used its procurement power to support national champions and to promote the development of new technologies. The government had the power to control the prices of key goods and services, which it used to manage inflation and to influence the allocation of resources. The state also played a direct role in the economy through its ownership of a large number of companies in strategic sectors, including energy, transport, and telecommunications. These state-owned enterprises were used to advance the government's economic objectives, and their managers were often drawn from the same elite corps of civil servants who staffed the planning commission and the ministries. [2] [4]

## 6. Evidence & Impact

The impact of French Dirigisme on the country's economic development has been profound and is a subject of ongoing debate. The most significant achievement associated with this framework is the period of rapid economic growth and social transformation known as the *Trente Glorieuses* (1945-1975). During these three decades, the French economy grew at an average annual rate of over 5%, leading to a dramatic increase in living standards and the modernization of French society. The country was transformed from a largely agrarian and fragmented economy into a major industrial power, with world-class infrastructure and a high-skilled workforce. However, the success of Dirigisme was not without its limitations and costs. The oil crisis of 1973 and the subsequent economic slowdown exposed the rigidities and inefficiencies of the model. State-owned enterprises, which had been the engines of growth in the post-war period, became increasingly uncompetitive and a drain on public finances. The close relationship between the state and big business also led to accusations of cronyism and a lack of transparency. By the 1980s, there was a growing consensus that the Dirigiste model had run its course. A series of governments, from both the left and the right, embarked on a program of liberalization, privatization, and deregulation, dismantling many of the key institutions of Dirigisme. While the state continues to play an important role in the French economy, it is no longer the all-powerful director of the post-war era. [1] [3]

## 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

In the cognitive era, characterized by the rise of the knowledge economy and the increasing importance of intangible assets, the traditional tools of Dirigisme may seem outdated. The focus on large-scale industrial projects and the promotion of national champions may be less relevant in a world where innovation is driven by nimble startups and global networks of collaboration. However, the core principles of Dirigisme – the idea that the state has a strategic role to play in shaping the future of the economy – may be more relevant than ever. The challenges of the 21st century, from climate change to the digital transformation, require a long-term vision and a coordinated effort from both the public and private sectors. The concept of a "neo-dirigisme" has emerged, which seeks to adapt the principles of Dirigisme to the new realities of the cognitive era. This new approach would involve the state playing a more enabling role, fostering innovation, investing in education and research, and creating a regulatory environment that is conducive to the growth of the knowledge economy. Rather than picking winners, the state would focus on creating the conditions for a vibrant and dynamic ecosystem of innovation. [3]

### 8. Commons Alignment Assessment (v2.0)

This assessment evaluates the pattern based on the Commons OS v2.0 framework, which focuses on the pattern's ability to enable resilient collective value creation.

**1. Stakeholder Architecture:**
The pattern establishes a rigid, top-down stakeholder architecture where the state and designated "national champions" hold most of the rights and responsibilities. Other stakeholders, such as smaller enterprises, the public, and the environment, are largely passive recipients of state-led strategy rather than active participants in governance. This centralization limits the development of a diverse and resilient ecosystem of value creation.

**2. Value Creation Capability:**
Dirigisme is exceptionally capable of creating economic and industrial value, as evidenced by the *Trente Glorieuses*. However, this focus is narrow and often comes at the expense of ecological and social value, which are not primary objectives of the framework. It excels at mobilizing resources for large-scale projects but is less effective at fostering the creation of intangible or non-monetized value like knowledge commons or community resilience.

**3. Resilience & Adaptability:**
While Dirigisme provided stability and resilience during the post-war reconstruction, its centralized and bureaucratic nature makes it inherently rigid and slow to adapt to complex, rapidly changing conditions. The model is designed to control and direct change rather than to thrive on it, as demonstrated by its struggles during the economic shifts of the 1970s. It maintains coherence under predictable stressors but lacks the adaptive capacity of more distributed systems.

**4. Ownership Architecture:**
Ownership is defined primarily through state control and conventional corporate equity, not as a distributed architecture of rights and responsibilities. The state acts as a steward, but its responsibilities are to the national interest as defined by a technocratic elite, not to a broad set of stakeholders. This model concentrates power and does not enable a sense of shared ownership over the value being created.

**5. Design for Autonomy:**
This pattern is fundamentally incompatible with autonomy. It relies on high-coordination overhead managed by a central authority, making it unsuitable for integration with DAOs, AI, or other distributed systems that thrive on low-level peer-to-peer interactions. The core logic of Dirigisme is one of command and control, the direct opposite of autonomous, emergent order.

**6. Composability & Interoperability:**
Dirigisme is a monolithic, all-encompassing national framework, making it difficult to compose with other patterns, especially those based on decentralized or community-led principles. It can be combined with other top-down bureaucratic patterns but clashes with bottom-up approaches. Its lack of modularity and high degree of centralization limit its ability to interoperate within a diverse ecosystem of governance models.

**7. Fractal Value Creation:**
The logic of Dirigisme does not apply at multiple scales. It is explicitly a national-level strategy that relies on the unique resources and authority of the state. The model of a central authority picking winners and directing investment cannot be easily replicated at the scale of a small community, a single company, or a digital network, which lack the coercive and financial power of a nation-state.

**Overall Score: 2 (Partial Enabler)**

**Rationale:**
Dirigisme is a powerful framework for industrial-era economic mobilization but is poorly aligned with the principles of a resilient, adaptive value-creation commons. Its centralization, narrow definition of value, and lack of support for autonomy and distributed governance place it in the legacy category. While it contains elements of stewardship, its architecture is too rigid and top-down to foster the collective capability that defines a true commons.

**Opportunities for Improvement:**
- Introduce polycentric governance models where regional and local bodies have more autonomy in economic planning.
- Redefine the concept of "national champions" to include networks of smaller, innovative firms and open-source projects, not just large corporations.
- Integrate multi-stakeholder feedback loops into the planning process, giving formal rights to environmental groups, citizen assemblies, and other non-state actors.
