Assembling the cross-functional allies, sponsors, and early adopters within an organisation needed to move an innovation from idea to institution.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Intrapreneurship / Organisational Change.

---

### Section 1: Context

Systems thinkers and intrapreneurs live in organisational ecosystems where fragmentation is the default state. Departments protect budgets and mandates. Hierarchies filter information vertically. Silos calcify around established processes and metrics. When someone inside the organisation sees a need—a broken workflow, an emerging threat, a regenerative opportunity—they face an immediate isolation: their insight sits outside formal resource flows and decision structures.

The loneliness of systems thinking deepens when the innovator realises that the problem *requires* cross-functional understanding. A product innovation needs design, operations, and market input. A sustainability initiative in government requires finance, service delivery, and policy alignment. A movement's internal infrastructure change demands both organisational veterans and new voices.

Yet the organisation doesn't have a ready mechanism for this assembly. Formal committees move slowly. Informal networks are invisible to budget holders. The innovator must become a bridge-builder—finding the people whose work touches the problem, mapping their constraints and motivations, and weaving them into a coalition before formal authority notices.

This pattern describes how to do that weaving: the relational and political work of gathering enough internal legitimacy, resource commitment, and distributed expertise that an innovation can move from sketchy idea into institutional reality. It is the work that precedes and enables every successful intrapreneurial initiative.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Building vs. Coalition.**

The innovator has a building impulse: to prototype, test, move fast, iterate toward concrete value. Coalition-building requires something different: patience, listening, negotiation, inclusion of people who might slow things down. The tension cuts deeper.

**The Building side** wants autonomy, speed, clarity of purpose. It fears that involving too many stakeholders will water down the idea, introduce competing agendas, and create bureaucratic friction. Coalitions slow momentum. They politicise decisions that should be technical.

**The Coalition side** knows that innovations that survive inside organisations need distributed legitimacy. A lonely brilliance dies when the innovator moves on, when budget cycles shift, when a single sponsor loses authority. Coalitions hold the system steady. They distribute risk and knowledge. But assembling them takes time, emotional labour, and willingness to reshape the original vision.

When the tension is unresolved, two pathologies emerge:

**Lone-builder burnout**: The innovator pushes ahead solo, protects the idea fiercely, and becomes exhausted and brittle. When resistance arrives (and it does), they have no allies. The initiative collapses or gets absorbed into something unrecognisable.

**Coalition bloat**: The innovator tries to include everyone early, seeking consensus before direction is clear. The group becomes a talking shop. Decision-making paralysis sets in. The original insight gets buried under competing priorities.

Both kill vitality. The first creates dependency and fragility. The second creates inertia.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, the practitioner deliberately sequences coalition-building in phases: anchoring a small core of strategically chosen allies first, proving value through early wins, then expanding the coalition by demonstrating tangible benefits to progressively wider circles.**

This pattern resolves the tension by making coalition-building *itself* a core practice of innovation, not an afterthought or distraction. The shift is profound: instead of "build something good, then convince people," it becomes "build something good *by* assembling the right people at the right moments."

The mechanism works through selective visibility and distributed problem-solving. Early, you identify the people whose work or authority touches the problem most directly: the operations leader whose workflow is broken, the finance officer who controls budget, the frontline staff who see the gap daily. These form a **core coalition**—small, aligned on diagnosis, empowered to reshape the idea together.

This core group doesn't slow the innovator. It speeds them up. They challenge assumptions that the lone builder would have missed. They surface real constraints early—when they can be designed around, not when the prototype is done. They develop ownership: this is their innovation now, not the innovator's baby.

Once the core has proof—a working prototype, measurable early results, or a coherent redesigned concept—the coalition expands. Now the practitioner brings in the people who *enable scale*: HR (if culture shift is needed), communications (who will legitimise the work), other department heads whose support matters for adoption.

Each expansion phase has a different logic. Early phases build depth of ownership. Later phases build breadth of legitimacy. The pattern mirrors how forest ecology works: roots establish first (core coalition), then trunk and branches spread (expanding coalition), then the ecosystem of other species moves in.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**1. Map the political-relational terrain.** Before you approach anyone, draw a simple map: Who does the problem actually affect? Who controls resources needed to solve it? Who has informal influence over decision-making? Mark each person's position: skeptical, neutral, or already aligned. This is not a PowerPoint—it's a working diagram you'll revise as you learn. Include the people you'd rather ignore: the department head who's blocked similar work, the process owner whose turf overlaps.

**2. Identify and anchor your core coalition.** Choose 2–4 people who meet all three criteria: they understand the problem from lived experience, they have sufficient authority that their commitment creates permission for others, and they have capacity to give real time (not just blessing). In **corporate** contexts, this might be a product manager, operations lead, and one customer-facing role. In **government**, anchor with a frontline service deliverer, a policy analyst, and a finance contact who understands budget mechanics. In **activist** movements, core members include someone with institutional memory, someone connected to leadership, and someone rooted in the affected community. In **tech**, your core spans product, engineering, and at least one user-research voice.

Approach each core member *individually* first. Spend 30–60 minutes with their actual problem, their constraints, their existing commitments. Propose the coalition as a solution to *their* problem, not as a favor to your initiative. Get explicit commitment: What time can they give? What decision-making authority do they need? What does success mean to them?

**3. Run fast cycles with the core.** Meet weekly, not monthly. Keep meetings tight (45 minutes). Bring a specific artifact each time—a flow diagram, a cost estimate, a user story, a risk register. Don't seek consensus on the big vision yet; build it through iterating on concrete details. **Corporate** teams: use this core to rapidly prototype process changes before rolling out. **Government**: co-design the policy logic with them, surface legal or compliance risks early. **Activist**: use core meetings to pressure-test strategy with people who know organizational culture. **Tech**: have the core define the smallest viable feature set and user cohort for first release.

**4. Generate early evidence.** The core coalition's job is to run a small test with real constraints: a pilot with actual customers, a 30-day process trial in one department, a demo with affected community members. Don't wait for perfection. Real friction teaches faster than strategy. Make this evidence visible and honest: what worked, what broke, what surprised us.

**5. Expand in concentric rings.** Once you have evidence, approach the next tier deliberately. These are the people who don't need to love the idea but need to not block it: other department heads, budget gatekeepers, people who own systems the innovation touches. With each person, lead with the evidence and their specific stakes. "We've tested this with 12 users and reduced processing time by 25%. For your team, it means X." No abstract benefits; specific, verifiable change relevant to their world.

**6. Create visible structure for ongoing coalition.** Once you're past 8–10 people, the coalition needs thin governance: a monthly check-in, clear roles for who makes what decisions, a shared working document (not a 50-slide deck) that tracks progress and emerging issues. In **corporate** and **tech** contexts, this might be a steering group with decision rights. In **government**, formalize it as a cross-agency working group with explicit cabinet or agency support. In **activist** movements, make it a working circle with clear accountability back to affected communities.

**7. Tend relationships continuously.** Coalition decay is faster than coalition building. Every month, have one 1:1 conversation with each core member outside the formal meeting. Listen for strain: overcommitment, shifting priorities, loss of faith. Address it then, not when it surfaces as passive resistance in the group. Celebrate wins together, small and large. Make space for people's doubts—they're not problems to solve, they're data about what's actually hard.

---

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

The innovation gains resilience through distributed ownership. When one ally moves to a different role, the work doesn't die—it's already embedded in three other people's mandates. Knowledge distributes across the coalition; no single person is the bottleneck. Early adopters in the coalition become champions in their networks, multiplying reach without the innovator's direct effort.

Cross-functional understanding deepens. The designer learns why finance worries about audit trails. The engineer understands the policy constraint that shapes the requirement. This shared understanding becomes the system's immune system—it can adapt because the decision-makers understand the interconnections.

Legitimacy accumulates visibly. An idea championed by one person is interesting. An idea championed by operations, finance, and customer success is institutional fact. This legitimacy compounds—it attracts resources, permission, and more allies.

**What risks emerge:**

**Coalition inertia** is real: once you have agreement from a group, it becomes harder to pivot, even when early evidence says you should. The solution is explicit permission to change. Build in quarterly "should we still do this?" gates. Name that coalition members' job includes challenging direction, not defending it.

**Distributed accountability can blur**: With ownership spread, sometimes no one feels responsible for delivering. Mitigate this by maintaining clear decision rights. Who decides on feature scope? Who decides on timeline? Use "disagree and commit" language: "I don't love this direction, and I'm committing to make it work."

**Resilience remains fragile** (score 3.0): Coalition-based innovations are resilient to personnel change but *brittle to institutional upheaval*. A merger, a budget crisis, a change in leadership can still collapse the whole thing. Vitality doesn't guarantee survival under systemic stress.

**Stakeholder architecture is incomplete** (score 3.0): This pattern assembles coalition among people already inside power structures. It doesn't necessarily include voices most affected by the innovation, especially if they're outside formal organizations. Watch for this blind spot, especially in **government** and **activist** contexts where community voice matters deeply to legitimacy.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Spotify's cross-functional squad model (2010s)**: Spotify's product innovation required coordinating dozens of teams across three cities and multiple time zones. Rather than centralise product decisions, they built "squad" coalitions: each squad was a mini-coalition of product, engineering, design, and data, with a clear mission and weekly synchronisation rituals. Squad coalitions scaled to hundreds of people without becoming bureaucratic because the coalitions were *the* decision-making unit, not a layer above it. Early squads generated evidence of their model's effectiveness; later squads formed with it as proven practice.

**UK Government Digital Service's GDS initiative (2010s)**: Martha Lane Fox and her core team faced massive institutional skepticism—government didn't *do* digital innovation. They started by anchoring a coalition of three: a policy director with deputy secretary access, a technology entrepreneur willing to work inside government, and a operations lead from the NHS. These three co-designed the first minimal proof: a small web platform for government service delivery. Only after showing it to actual citizens and proving it reduced processing time did they expand the coalition to include other departments. Within 18 months, GDS became institutional; within five years, it had reshaped how government approached digital. The core coalition's deliberate cross-functionality (policy, tech, operations) meant they could surface and solve integration problems others would have missed.

**Patagonia's environmental-responsibility coalition** (1990s onward): Patagonia's shift toward sustainable materials and ethical supply chains didn't happen top-down. Founder Yvon Chouinard anchored a coalition of the VP of product (skeptical but detail-oriented), the supply-chain operations lead, and one customer-facing retail manager who heard directly from climbers and mountaineers about their values. This core trio spent 18 months piloting organic cotton and regenerative practices on a single product line. Once they had evidence—customer enthusiasm, manageable cost delta, visible quality—they expanded to include marketing, investor relations, and eventually retail partners. The coalition became the business model; today, Patagonia's commitment to environmental responsibility is inseparable from its internal coalition structure. The pattern embedded in the company's culture.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

AI and distributed intelligence systems change this pattern significantly, creating both new leverage and new risks.

**New leverage**: Coalition-building can now be data-informed in real time. Instead of relying on gut-read maps of stakeholder positions, practitioners can use network analysis, communication-pattern mapping, and natural-language analysis of existing documents to identify who actually influences whom and where decision-making power flows. This makes coalition architect faster. Chatbots and AI scheduling can handle the low-touch relationship maintenance that otherwise becomes the innovator's burden. Shared AI-assisted working documents mean the coalition has always-updated shared understanding of problems and solutions—reducing the meeting time needed to stay aligned.

**New risks**: Over-reliance on network analysis can miss the informal, trust-based relationships that actually hold coalitions together. An algorithm might flag that the finance director "should" be in the coalition based on decision authority, missing that the operations lead already has her ear and can carry the message more credibly. AI-mediated communication in distributed teams can accelerate information sharing but erode the relationship texture that makes people willing to take risks for each other's initiatives.

**Tech product implications**: In software and hardware development, AI is changing who needs to be in the coalition. Data scientists and AI/ML engineers now have decision-making authority that was previously isolated in product and engineering. Building internal coalition for products now means including roles that didn't exist three years ago—the responsible AI officer, the data governance person, the community feedback loop integrator. Early coalitions that don't include this distributed intelligence will design blind.

**Activist movement implication**: AI-driven information asymmetry (some people have algorithmic profiling tools, others don't) creates new power dynamics inside coalitions. Building authentic coalition in a high-AI environment means being explicit about data practices and ensuring that coalitions include people who understand and can interrogate algorithmic decision-making, not just domain expertise.

The pattern itself survives. Coalition-building will remain how innovations embed in organisations. But the *intelligence profile* of coalitions is shifting. Practitioners need to think actively about who has data literacy, who understands system feedback loops, and how algorithmic intelligence shapes the coalition's shared understanding.

---

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

Coalition members spontaneously defend the initiative to peers, without being asked. They're not just attending meetings; they're carrying the work back into their domains. You overhear a finance person explaining the initiative to her team, or an ops lead sketching the new process to a peer from another department.

Early evidence of impact appears quickly and gets shared widely. The coalition regularly surfaces new constraints or opportunities, meaning the innovation is learning and adapting in real time. Each meeting generates at least one change to approach, informed by coalition members' lived experience.

New people ask to join. The coalition becomes known as where real problem-solving happens; people want to be part of it. When you approach someone in the second ring, they often already know about the work and are expecting your outreach.

**Signs of decay:**

Coalition meetings become status reports instead of problem-solving. People attend and give updates, but they're not reshaping the work together. Decisions happen before or after the meeting, not during it. The coalition is being *informed*, not involved.

Attendance drifts. Core members start sending substitutes or stop showing up. When you check in, they cite competing priorities. If more than one core member is drifting, the coalition is fragmenting and the work is about to become a lonely project again.

The coalition stops generating evidence. No tests run, no prototypes with real users, no documentation of what's working and what isn't. Instead, debate happens at the abstract level—"will people use this?" instead of "did those 20 users use it?" without real data, coalition members retreat to their assumptions.

**When to replant:**

When core coalition members have moved roles or left the organization, the pattern needs redesign—not because the coalition has failed, but because people are the carriers of relationship and understanding. Take a month to let the work pause. Then rebuild the core intentionally, using what you learned from the previous iteration. A replanted coalition learns faster because it inherits the institutional memory, even if the faces are different.

Replant also when the work is about to move from innovation to business-as-usual. At that inflection point, the coalition's purpose changes: it was assembling to move an idea into being; now it needs to become the governance structure that keeps the practice healthy and evolving. If you don't deliberately redesign the coalition's role for this new season, both the people and the practice will decay.
