### Section 1: Context

Commons stewards constantly borrow patterns from other domains. A movement learns governance from a cooperative. An organisation adopts decision-making structures from indigenous councils. A product team imports user-participation models from open-source communities. This cross-pollination is vital — it accelerates learning and prevents parochial reinvention. Yet borrowed patterns often fail silently, appearing to work while hollowing out from within.

The tension sharpens in moments of system maturation. Early-stage projects can tolerate pattern mismatch because everything is still fluid. But as a commons grows — more stakeholders, deeper commitment, real stakes — imported structures start to misalign with actual flows of work, power, and value. A decision protocol that thrived in a 20-person collective fractures under 200 people. A funding model that worked for one activist ecosystem depletes resources when applied to another with different rhythms of contribution. A product feature that succeeded in one market context creates friction in a new geography.

The problem is epistemological. We inherit patterns through analogy — *that worked there, so it should work here* — but analogy is always incomplete. It smuggles in hidden assumptions about scale, culture, resource availability, external constraint, and stakeholder motivation. These assumptions remain invisible until they break something.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Contextual vs. Validity.**

One side demands **Validity**: patterns that work deserve to be reused. We have limited time and imagination. Why reinvent when others have already solved this shape of problem? Borrowing proven patterns is efficient and humble — it respects the work of others and accelerates collective learning.

The other side demands **Contextual**: every system is specific. Its history, power asymmetries, available resources, external pressures, and stakeholder composition are unique. A pattern borrowed without adaptation becomes a Procrustean bed — you either stretch the system to fit the pattern or amputate the parts that don't conform. Both damage vitality.

When this tension goes unresolved, practitioners operate in fog. They commit to a borrowed pattern and discover months later that it was the wrong fit. The sunk cost is high: people have aligned to it, invested emotional energy, reshaped workflows around it. Reversing course is painful. Alternatively, teams become pattern-allergic — every borrowed idea is rejected as "not understanding our context" — and the commons fragments into isolated reinvention, losing the speed and resilience that pattern knowledge provides.

The deepest cost is epistemic: practitioners lose confidence in their own ability to judge. Did the pattern fail because we didn't implement it well, or because it was never valid here? Teams oscillate between self-blame and defensive rejection, neither of which generates learning.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, before adopting a pattern, run a deliberate validity test — a structured inquiry that maps the pattern's hidden assumptions against your actual context, making misfits visible before commitment.**

This is not academic validation. It is practitioner-level hypothesis testing: *What conditions made this pattern work elsewhere? Which of those conditions are present here? Which are absent? Which absences are fatal?*

The mechanism shifts three things at once.

**First, it makes assumption-work visible.** Every pattern carries embedded assumptions — about scale, about what motivates people, about resource scarcity, about power distribution, about external threat or stability. These assumptions are usually invisible because they were obvious in the pattern's origin context. Validity testing exhumes them. A practitioner asks: *What had to be true for this to work there?* This question alone produces clarity.

**Second, it separates misalignment from implementation failure.** If a validity test reveals that a pattern's core conditions aren't met, you know the problem isn't lazy execution — it's structural. You can then choose consciously: adapt the pattern to fit your context, or search for a different pattern. This choice is grounded, not reactive.

**Third, it builds commons learning culture.** When a pattern is tested before use, failures become diagnostic rather than demoralising. The pattern didn't fail because people are incompetent; it failed because the conditions were different. That insight is generalisable. You document not just *what worked* but *under what conditions it worked* — which becomes seed material for future pattern borrowers.

From a living systems view: this pattern treats borrowed structures as seeds, not blueprints. A seed carries encoded potential, but that potential only germinates in the right soil, light, and moisture. Validity testing is the work of understanding your soil. Plant blindly, and the seed rots. Test first, and you either enrich the soil or choose a different seed.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

The validity test has four movements. Run them sequentially, with rest between, so insight settles.

**Movement 1: Name the pattern explicitly.** Write down the pattern you're considering — its core logic, its key practices, its claimed benefits. Be specific. Not "collective decision-making" but "consent-based decision-making where any participant can block a proposal if it causes them harm." This precision is crucial. Vague patterns hide vague assumptions.

**Movement 2: Exhume the assumptions.** Gather the practitioners who know the pattern's origin well — either people from that context, or deep students of it. Ask them: *What had to be true for this to work there?* Listen for unstated conditions. Assumptions will cluster around: scale (how many people?), resource flows (what was the funding model?), time horizons (how patient were stakeholders?), external pressure (what was the threat or opportunity landscape?), culture (what values dominated?), and power distribution (who held veto, budget, direction-setting?).

Corporate context: In an organisation adopting the Holacracy pattern from software, surface the assumption that role-clarity and explicit protocols matter more than relationship-trust. If your org runs on implicit trust and loose role boundaries, this assumption may be misaligned. Test it by asking: *How much friction do we currently experience because roles are unclear, vs. because relationships are strained?*

Government context: If a public agency is borrowing the "community participatory budgeting" pattern from a civic engagement programme, exhume the assumption that citizens have time, education, and motivation to engage in detailed budget work. Ask: *What socioeconomic profile participated in the origin context? How does it compare to our constituents? Will transport, childcare, or language be barriers here?*

Activist context: When a movement adopts a decentralised coordination structure from another movement, surface the assumption about surveillance risk and police threat. Ask: *Was the origin context in a high-surveillance environment? If we're in lower threat, will elaborate security practices create burnout? If we're in higher threat, will transparency create vulnerability?*

Tech context: If a product team is importing an open-source community governance model, exhume the assumption about contributor motivation. Ask: *What percentage of contributions in the origin came from paid maintainers vs. volunteers? How does our contributor base compare?*

**Movement 3: Map gaps and non-negotiables.** Create a simple table:

| Assumption | Present in Origin? | Present in Our Context? | Critical or Flexible? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scale (e.g., <50 people) | Yes | No (we're 300) | Critical |
| Shared ideology | Yes | Partial | Flexible |

The "Critical or Flexible" column is the hard one. Ask: *If this condition is absent, does the pattern break functionally, or just feel awkward?* If it breaks functionally, you have three choices: change your context (not usually possible), adapt the pattern substantially, or don't use it. If it's just uncomfortable, you might proceed with eyes open.

**Movement 4: Run a small test.** Don't implement the pattern at scale. Run it with a subgroup or for a defined period — two months, not two years. Measure not whether people like it, but whether the pattern's core claims hold: Does it actually speed decisions? Does it distribute power? Does it surface conflict? Real data beats intuition.

After the test, pause before full adoption. Gather the test group and ask: *What surprised you? Where did the pattern assume things that aren't true here? What adaptations made it work?* Document these findings. They become your pattern's local variant.

---

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

Borrowed patterns now land more softly. Teams adopt them with eyes open about trade-offs, not blind faith. This generates two capacities: first, faster learning because you're not debugging misalignment; second, stronger pattern culture because patterns are now tools, not gospel. People develop pattern literacy — the ability to read a pattern, understand its logic, and ask *does this fit?* rather than *should I obey this?*

Collaboration deepens across commons. When practitioners test validity and share findings, they build a commons knowledge base that's actually useful: not just *what worked* but *under what conditions*. This is composability — patterns become modular, remixable, localisable. The composability score (4.5) reflects this real strength.

Failure becomes diagnostic rather than demoralising. When a pattern doesn't work, practitioners know whether it's a bad fit (structural) or bad execution (practitioner). This distinction is generative. Structural misfits teach you about your context. Execution failures teach you about capability.

**What risks emerge:**

The test itself can become a stalling tactic. Practitioners can mask risk-aversion or political resistance as "validity testing." If the testing phase drags on indefinitely, it becomes procrastination. Set clear timeframes: two weeks for exhumation, two months for small test, decision by day 45.

Validity testing can calcify into false certainty. A test that shows *some* conditions are absent doesn't prove the pattern will fail — it just creates contingency. Some practitioners interpret this as reason to reject patterns outright. The opposite error: overconfidence in a test that went well. Small tests don't reveal what happens at scale.

The pattern can drift into cargo cult if testing becomes performative — teams go through the motions of validity testing but don't actually change course based on findings. Watch for this: if your tests always conclude *yes, adopt it,* you're probably not testing; you're rubber-stamping.

Because this pattern sustains existing functioning without necessarily generating new adaptive capacity, watch for rigidity if implementation becomes routinised. If validity testing becomes a mandatory bureaucratic gate, it can slow down the experimentation and creativity that keeps commons vital. The resilience score (3.0) reflects this: the pattern maintains equilibrium but doesn't build robustness.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).** Governments borrowed democratic participatory governance models from NGO networks, aiming to make resource extraction visible to citizens. The validity test that should have happened: *Does public participation in budget scrutiny work when most citizens lack technical knowledge of mining finance?* and *What happens when the government also controls the media?* Countries that skipped this test saw low engagement and poor outcomes. Countries like Ghana that adapted the pattern — adding technical support and working through trusted local organisations rather than assuming citizen literacy — saw higher vitality. The learning: borrowed governance patterns require cultural translation, not just structural copy.

**The Occupy Wall Street Movement and Consensus Decision-Making.** Occupy adopted consensus-based decision processes from indigenous councils and Quaker traditions. The assumption: consensus builds solidarity and distributes power horizontally. The unexamined condition: in origin contexts, populations were smaller and shared deep ideological alignment. Occupy skipped the validity test. Consensus proved slow and paralysing at scale, with decision-fatigue and dominant voices masquerading as emergent agreement. Movements that explicitly tested this assumption — like the Movement for Black Lives — adapted it: they kept consensus for values and direction, used faster processes for tactics. This is validity testing in action: same pattern, locally modified because context was understood first.

**Agile Software Development in Government.** Tech teams borrowed Agile (two-week sprints, continuous deployment) from startup contexts. The hidden assumption: rapid feedback loops work when users can iterate and tolerate failure. Government systems required longer regulatory approval cycles and zero-tolerance for downtime. Teams that skipped validity testing burned out or reverted to Waterfall. Agencies like the UK Government Digital Service explicitly tested: *Do our stakeholders have appetite for iterative delivery? What's the minimum change-batch that still requires sign-off?* This testing produced a hybrid — Agile-informed but not pure Agile — that stuck because it was context-calibrated, not borrowed wholesale.

---

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

AI changes the stakes and the leverage of this pattern.

**The new risk:** AI makes pattern borrowing seductive and dangerous. Large language models excel at pattern recognition and transfer — they see structural analogies across domains instantly. A team building a commons on an AI system might ask: *What governance model worked for open-source projects?* An AI system can surface 20 analogies in seconds and present them as obviously transferable. The risk is that speed of analogy generation outpaces judgment about contextual fit. Teams might adopt patterns because an AI suggested them, not because they tested them. The pattern's confidence score could become illusory.

**The new leverage:** AI can accelerate validity testing itself. An AI system trained on pattern histories — blockchain governance, cooperative decision-making, open-source contribution models — can help practitioners exhume hidden assumptions. Ask: *What conditions made consensus-based governance work in these fifteen documented cases?* An AI can pattern-match across histories faster than human researchers. This doesn't replace human judgment, but it can surface assumptions that would otherwise stay invisible. A product team can ask an AI: *Here are the conditions of our market. Which of these borrowed patterns have succeeded in similar markets before?*

**For products specifically (tech context):** Contextual Pattern Validity becomes critical as products scale across geographies. A social platform's governance model that works in one country may be dangerous in another. AI-driven recommendations can accelerate deployment of a pattern into a new market before local validity is tested. The friction — the moment when validity testing would happen — gets compressed. Building automated validity testing into product deployment (checking: *Has this feature's underlying governance assumption been tested in this market?*) becomes a design obligation, not optional hygiene.

The deepest shift: in an AI-saturated commons, the ability to test pattern validity becomes a form of epistemic sovereignty. Teams that develop validity-testing capacity resist being automated into compliance with patterns they didn't choose. This is increasingly a commons resilience issue.

---

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

Borrowed patterns land and take root. You can observe practitioners adopting a pattern, hitting expected friction points from the validity test, adapting it consciously, and having it stick. The pattern isn't rigid — it's context-fitted. You also see practitioners *declining* patterns with confidence: *We tested this, it assumes X, we don't have X, so we're not using it.* This confidence is a sign the pattern is working. Teams document their tests and share findings. You see records of *why* a pattern was adopted or rejected, not just *that* it was. This builds commons memory.

Failure discussions shift in tone. Instead of *we implemented it wrong,* you hear *this pattern assumes Y and we're actually Z.* The locus of analysis moves from blame to learning. You also see cross-domain conversations: a government team learning from an activist group's validity test of a decision-making structure, or a tech team adapting findings from a cooperative's experience.

**Signs of decay:**

Validity testing becomes a box-ticking exercise. Teams complete a validity test and adopt the pattern regardless of findings. You can tell by the absence of adaptation — the pattern is implemented exactly as described elsewhere, with no local modifications, even though the test revealed misalignments. Tests are shallow or rushed: exhumation of assumptions takes two hours instead of two weeks. Findings are weak: *we think this will work* rather than *we tested it and here's what we learned.*

Teams stop borrowing patterns altogether, retreating into pure reinvention. The pattern becomes so onerous that people avoid it and rebuild from scratch every time. You hear: *Why bother testing? Everything's different anyway.* The commons becomes fragmented and learning stops flowing. Teams treat validity test failures as signal to reject the pattern entirely, without exploring adaptation. A government team tests participatory budgeting, finds citizens lack technical knowledge, and abandons the model entirely — rather than adding technical support, as Ghana did.

**When to replant:**

When you notice patterns landing without adaptation — they're working the same way everywhere — it's time to restart validity testing. This suggests the pattern has drifted into dogma. Restart by asking: *What has changed in our context since we last tested this?* If you see teams avoiding borrowed patterns altogether and reinventing constantly, you have rigidity in the opposite direction. Replant by running a validity test on a pattern that's already local and trusted, as a way to rebuild confidence in the process itself. Use it not as a gate but as a learning ritual. The right moment is when your commons is maturing — when you have enough complexity that pattern mismatch starts to show, but enough slack to test deliberately before full commitment.
