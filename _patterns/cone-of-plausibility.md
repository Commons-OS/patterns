Understanding your personal cone — what futures are actually possible for you — enables realistic planning grounded in your real constraints and capacities.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Possibility Space.

---

### Section 1: Context

You live in a system where futures thinking is everywhere — strategy decks, sustainability plans, career development workshops — yet most people experience a crushing gap between the futures they're told to imagine and the futures their actual life can sustain. The Possibility Space tradition offers the Cone of Plausibility: a mapping of possible, plausible, and preferable futures expanding from present to future. But this cone is typically applied at organisational, sector, or systems scale. What breaks in the application is the personal layer: individuals internalize futures that are *theoretically* possible but *practically* impossible given their constraints — capital, time, relational capacity, health, location, privilege. In corporate contexts, this shows up as burnout-inducing transformation roadmaps. In government, as policy visions disconnected from street-level implementation capacity. In activism, as burnout cycles where people commit to futures their actual lives cannot sustain. In product work, as feature roadmaps that ignore the real constraints of small teams. The pattern emerges because individuals need a way to distinguish between the futures they *should* want and the futures they can *actually* cultivate within their particular life-system.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is The vs. Personally.**

The abstraction (The) — the generalised futures cone, the organisational mandate, the movement's vision — expands endlessly. It contains everything theoretically possible: you could learn Mandarin, lead a team, ship a product, build community infrastructure, all simultaneously. The personal narrows it ruthlessly: you have 24 hours, limited capital, relational bandwidth, health constraints, geography, existing commitments. When these collide unexamined, people oscillate between two failure modes. First: they collapse the cone into *The* and ignore personal constraints, creating plans that decay under their own weight — abandoned side projects, incomplete commitments, movements that burn through people. Second: they collapse the cone into the *Personally* and accept severe contraction — "I can't possibly do that work," "This vision isn't for people like me" — and stop experimenting entirely. The tension breaks because neither side speaks truth alone. *The* needs the personal to be actionable; the *Personally* needs *The* to avoid parochialism. Without mapping your actual plausibility cone — the futures genuinely possible *for you, given your real life* — you either over-commit or under-reach. Both drain vitality from the commons you steward.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, map your personal cone of plausibility: identify which futures are possible (you have or can build the capacity), plausible (they cohere with your actual constraints), and preferable (they align with what you genuinely value), then plan in that bounded space.**

This pattern works by making the invisible visible. You cannot plan in a cone you cannot see. The mechanism is straightforward: you identify your actual constraints (not aspirational, not what you *wish* were true), you map what futures become possible within those constraints, and you distinguish the plausible from the merely possible. Then you *choose* which plausible futures you prefer, and you build from there.

Here's what shifts: instead of perpetually negotiating between what you "should" do and what you can do, you operate from a grounded yes. You know which futures are real for you. You can commit without brittleness. This is vitally different from resignation — resignation collapses the cone by assuming constraints are absolute. This pattern *tests* your constraints; it asks: given who I actually am, what futures can I genuinely cultivate? Some constraints are real (you cannot be in two places at once; you have limited capital; you have responsibilities). Some are assumed (you cannot do that work; you're not the right kind of person; your context is too hostile). The pattern creates the distinction.

In living systems terms, this is root-work. You're not building new branches without knowing what soil you're growing in. Possibility Space teaches that futures are not predetermined; they emerge from present capacities. Your personal cone maps the *actual* capacities in your system — your time, your skills, your relationships, your location, your health, your capital. From this map, plausible futures grow. You stop burning energy on futures that cannot sustain themselves in your actual ecosystem.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**The core practice unfolds in three acts: constraint mapping, cone drawing, and preference setting.**

**Constraint mapping**: Write down the non-negotiables in your life right now. Not aspirations; not what you want to be true. What *is* true? How many hours per week are genuinely available for new commitments? What are your relational obligations (caring for people, stewarding relationships)? What capital do you have access to — financial, intellectual, social? What is your health reality — energy level, chronic conditions, recovery time? What is your geography — are you mobile or rooted? What are your existing commitments? For a **corporate context**, this might be: "I have 5 hours/week beyond my job for development work; I have access to internal networks and $2k/year in learning budget; I am risk-averse about my employment. I have two young children and am solo-parenting 50% of the time." For a **government official**, this might be: "My role changes every 2–3 years; I have limited personal budget; I must operate within regulatory constraints; I have high visibility and low anonymity." For an **activist**, this might be: "I have 10 hours/week to give; I have relational capital in my neighbourhood but limited financial resources; my safety is a real constraint; I'm burnt out from previous cycles." For a **product founder**, this might be: "My team is 3 people; we have 8 months of runway; we have no institutional backing; I'm the only person who understands the architecture."

**Cone drawing**: Using your constraints as the *base* of the cone, map three rings outward. *Possible*: What futures become genuinely possible given your constraints? Not everything — the cone narrows immediately. The activist with 10 hours/week cannot build a citywide infrastructure project alone. The product founder with 3 people cannot ship to 5 platforms. The corporate professional cannot lead transformation while maintaining their primary role. Get specific. Draw the actual boundary. *Plausible*: Within the possible futures, which ones cohere? Which ones reinforce each other rather than competing for the same scarce resources (time, capital, attention)? For the activist: "I could deepen relational work in 3 blocks; I could run a monthly gathering; I could document and share what I learn. These three cohere." For the product founder: "We could ship a tight feature set for one use case, get deep customer feedback, and iterate. We cannot also build an app, a web interface, and an API simultaneously." *Preferable*: Of the plausible futures, which ones align with what you actually value — not what you're supposed to value? This is the hardest question. The activist might discover: "I prefer deepening relational capacity over scaling quickly; I prefer long-term renewal over heroic short-term effort." The corporate professional might discover: "I prefer developing three people deeply over being visible in strategy work; I prefer slow compounding over flashy outcomes."

**Preference setting**: Write a one-page description of your preferred future within your plausible cone. What are you building? What will it feel like? What will it require from you? What will it enable? Use this as your north star. Use it to say no. Use it to track whether you're still in your cone or drifting into someone else's.

**Refresh the practice quarterly**. Constraints shift. New capacity emerges. Burnout or breakthroughs change what's plausible. The cone is not static; it's a living map that needs tending.

---

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

You stop wasting energy on futures that cannot sustain themselves. This frees real capacity. People who map their cone report a paradoxical expansion: by accepting real constraints, they become more ambitious within them. You can commit to your chosen futures without the constant background anxiety of overcommitment. This stability enables deeper work. You become a reliable collaborator — people can trust you because you know what you can actually do. You model for others that personal honesty about constraints is not weakness; it's the foundation of sustainable co-creation. In activist contexts, this pattern is life-saving: it breaks the burnout cycle by creating permission to work at human scale. In corporate and product contexts, it generates better strategy because the people closest to execution have named their real limits.

**What risks emerge:**

The pattern can calcify if you treat your current constraints as permanent. "I can only work 5 hours/week, so I should accept smaller futures indefinitely." Constraints do shift; capacity grows. The risk is mistaking today's plausibility for tomorrow's. Watch for this especially in government and tech contexts, where conditions change rapidly. Because this pattern scores 3.0 or lower on resilience, ownership, and autonomy, there's a real danger: if the pattern becomes purely about accepting constraints rather than testing and expanding them, the system becomes rigid rather than adaptive. Someone who maps their cone in 2020 and never revisits it may miss 2025's new possibilities. The pattern also risks becoming individualistic — "my cone, my preferences" — rather than relational. Your plausibility cone is not separate from the commons you're part of. If everyone contracts into their own cone without examining how cones can expand together, the collective system loses adaptive capacity. Finally, the pattern can be misused as a tool for enforcing scarcity mindsets: "You should accept less because your constraints are real." The remedy is remembering that constraint-mapping is followed by *preference-setting* — by agency, by choice, not resignation.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Story 1: The activist collective in Detroit.** Between 2018–2022, a group of neighbourhood organisers used a constraint-mapping practice drawn from Possibility Space to shift from burnout to sustainability. They named it plainly: five core people, 10–15 hours each per week, no budget, rooted in three adjacent blocks, committed to 5+ years. Within those constraints, they asked: what futures are plausible? They discovered that attempting citywide campaigns was impossible; deepening relational infrastructure in their blocks was plausible. They began hosting monthly potlucks, training neighbours in basic repair skills, and documenting hyperlocal history. Five years in, they're still there. The pattern worked because they stopped comparing their cone to movement visions that required different scale and stayed in their actual territory.

**Story 2: The corporate product manager.** A director at a healthcare software company spent 2020–2021 exhausted by strategic visions that required her to lead transformation, mentor six people, maintain her technical credibility, and stay visible in executive circles — all while managing a chaotic remote transition. She mapped her actual cone: 55 hours/week capacity, 2 hours/week of genuine discretionary energy (not aspirational), relational capital with her immediate team, limited executive visibility. She asked: what's plausible? She discovered that deepening her team's craft, shipping incrementally, and building trust was plausible. Leading transformation was not. She made a choice. She stopped fighting her constraints and set expectations with her leadership: "I will build the best small team you've seen, ship reliably, and improve our customer outcomes over 18 months. I will not pursue visibility work or mentor outside my team." This clarity allowed her to deliver. She's now known for sustainable shipping, not strategic presence.

**Story 3: The policy team in local government.** A team responsible for adaptation planning in a mid-sized city spent years producing visionary reports that sat unimplemented. When they mapped their plausibility cone, they discovered: they had three permanent staff, high political turnover (every 2–3 years), no budget for pilots, but deep legitimacy with community groups. They asked: what futures are plausible? Not: design city-wide adaptation strategy and drive municipal adoption. Instead: co-design three neighbourhood-scale projects, document what works, make knowledge available to incoming administrations. Over six years, this approach generated compounding knowledge and genuine local shifts. The pattern worked because they stopped reaching for visions that required institutional continuity they didn't have.

---

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age of AI and networked intelligence, this pattern becomes both more critical and more complex. The pressure to imagine endless futures — powered by AI scenario generation, big data forecasting, algorithmic recommendations — expands the abstract cone dramatically. You can now generate thousands of plausible-sounding futures with machine help. The pattern's value intensifies: you need *personal* grounding more urgently, not less. The trap deepens, too: it becomes easier to assume your constraints are negotiable if you have access to AI tools. "I can't scale this alone, but AI can help." Sometimes true; often a seduction.

For the **tech context** specifically — building products in the age of AI — this pattern is essential friction. A founder or product team can generate infinite feature possibilities with AI assistance. But their actual cone hasn't changed: they still have limited engineering capacity, limited user attention, limited time to market. The pattern saves teams from what Possibility Space calls "cone proliferation": the hallucination that because *technically* more is possible, it's *practically* plausible. Teams using this pattern are shipping tighter products with deeper coherence.

The pattern also shifts at the systems level. In a cognitive era, your plausibility cone is increasingly networked. You're not alone in it; you're adjacent to others' cones. The leverage emerges when multiple people consciously work at their personal-cone scale and build *interfaces* between cones rather than trying to expand individual cones infinitely. This is composability (scored 3.0 in commons assessment). AI creates new leverage here: you can now map and share constraint data, identify where cones can usefully overlap, and coordinate without requiring centralized direction.

The risk: AI can be used to obscure constraints rather than name them. "Let's use AI to work around your time limits" often means "let's pretend constraints don't matter." The pattern's antidote is disciplined honesty about what even AI-assisted work demands: attention, judgment, relationship, trust. These don't scale infinitely.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

You notice people making commitments they actually keep. In corporate contexts, this shows up as projects that complete rather than extend indefinitely. In activist work, it's people showing up consistently without the desperation of overcommitment. In government, it's steady progress on constrained initiatives rather than spinning on grand visions. You hear language shift: instead of "I should be doing more," you hear "I'm building something real in my actual capacity." People talk about their cones openly — constraints become information, not shame. You see people declining opportunities without guilt, because they can articulate why those opportunities fall outside their plausibility cone. New people ask to learn the practice because they notice others aren't burnt out.

**Signs of decay:**

The cone becomes an excuse rather than a map. You hear: "My constraints are fixed; nothing can change." The pattern has collapsed into resignation. People stop revisiting their cones; what was mapped in 2022 is treated as permanent in 2025. You notice people in the same role describing wildly different cones — not because they're different people, but because they've never actually done the mapping work; they're just complaining. The commons loses coherence because individual cones never actually connect; everyone retreats into personal optimization. You see people using the language of the cone to enforce scarcity on others: "That's outside your cone, so you shouldn't try." The pattern has shifted from self-knowledge to gatekeeping.

**When to replant:**

Revisit your cone when your life conditions shift substantially — a new role, a health change, a relational shift, a capital change. Don't wait for annual reviews. And critically: if you notice your plausibility cone hasn't expanded in 18 months, replant. Not because it's bad to have stable constraints, but because human systems are adaptive; if nothing has shifted, you may not be testing your actual limits. The moment to redesign is when the pattern becomes routine without vitality — when people know the language but no longer examine their actual capacity. Return to the ground: What is true about your life right now?
