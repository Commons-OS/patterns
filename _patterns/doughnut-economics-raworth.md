Use Kate Raworth's doughnut model—social foundation within planetary boundaries—as the design frame for economic systems that create shared prosperity without ecological overshoot.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Sustainable Economics.

### Section 1: Context

Economic systems across sectors are fracturing. Organizations feel the collision between shareholder extraction and stakeholder survival. Governments oscillate between growth mandates and ecological emergency. Movements struggle to articulate what they're building toward, not just what they're against. Tech companies face mounting pressure to embed purpose beyond user engagement metrics. The Doughnut Economics framework emerged precisely in this fragmentation—a regenerative alternative to GDP growth that names a safe and just operating space for human systems. It's gaining traction in municipal governance (Amsterdam, Copenhagen), organizational design, and activist strategy because it translates abstract sustainability into concrete, measurable boundaries. Yet the framework itself is underused as a commons design tool—most implementations treat it as a communication device rather than a structural redesign lever. The living ecosystem here is characterized by hunger for coherent operating principles that honor both social needs and ecological limits, but also by uncertainty about how to move from model to migration.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Doughnut vs. Raworth.**

The tension sits between two impulses: the *Doughnut* as universal design principle versus *Raworth's* specific framing as a transition tool for existing systems. The Doughnut model (two concentric circles: social foundation inside, planetary boundaries outside) is potent precisely because it's context-agnostic—it applies to a startup, a city, a supply network. But Raworth herself emphasizes that the model must be *localized* and *co-created* within specific communities to have teeth. This breaks apart when practitioners try to deploy the Doughnut as a pre-fab blueprint rather than as a participatory mapping process. Organizations overlay it onto hierarchical budgeting and call it done. Governments use it for optics while keeping extraction-based procurement. Activists cite it without redesigning their own resource flows. The framework promises integration of social and ecological thriving, but implementations often fragment: one team optimizes for social needs, another for carbon reduction, and they never meet. What breaks is legitimacy and regenerative depth. The framework becomes another compliance layer, not a living redesign of how value flows through the system.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, treat the Doughnut as a living map that the whole system co-authors, resurveys quarterly, and uses to reshape resource flows and decision rights in real time.**

The shift is from *doughnut-as-audit* to *doughnut-as-navigation*. This pattern works because it makes the normally invisible boundaries visible and contested—not in a brittle way, but as living feedback. Each quadrant of the Doughnut (social needs: food, water, health, education, income, networks, energy, gender equality, social equity, political voice; planetary boundaries: climate, biodiversity, land use, freshwater, nitrogen, phosphorus, ocean acidification, air pollution, chemical pollution) becomes a sensing post. The system learns where it's creating scarcity (shortfall) and where it's regenerating depletion (overshoot). This is root work: you're not auditing against an external standard. You're asking: *what does thriving look like for this particular system and its territory?*

The mechanism operates through recursive mapping cycles. First, stakeholders name what "enough" means for each social foundation element—not theoretically, but locally anchored (e.g., not abstract "health" but "elders can access mental healthcare within 20 minutes" or "food is grown without synthetic nitrogen runoff"). Simultaneously, they measure planetary pressure: what are we drawing down? What are we poisoning? The Doughnut becomes a commons accounting ledger—shared, visible, contestable. When a decision arises (hiring, procurement, product release), it gets tested against the map: does this move us toward the safe and just space, or away? This creates natural friction and renegotiation, which is the point. The pattern relies on Raworth's core insight that economic systems are not natural laws but human designs that can be redesigned. You're cultivating a practice of ongoing redesign rooted in place.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**For corporate organizations:** Establish a Doughnut Steering Circle of 8–12 people spanning production, finance, HR, supply chain, and frontline roles. Their first act is a 3-month localized Doughnut mapping: measure current performance against both social foundation metrics (staff turnover, wage adequacy, supplier community impact) and planetary boundary use (carbon intensity, water stress, chemical leakage). Make this visible on a shared dashboard accessible to all. Then redesign incentives: tie leadership compensation to shortfall closure, not growth-at-any-cost. Reproc ure from suppliers who can demonstrate doughnut trajectory. Eliminate products that demand overshoot to remain profitable. Quarterly reviews aren't compliance checks—they're stakeholder conversations where the map itself gets contested and updated. This requires reshaping finance's authority: the CFO becomes a translator of the Doughnut, not a growth maximizer.

**For government:** Convene a Doughnut Parliament—a mixed assembly of residents, civil servants, businesses, and ecological experts who co-design the local doughnut every 18 months. Fund this as a structural decision-making process, not a consultation theater. Anchor budgeting to the boundaries: can we afford this policy *and* keep carbon within safe space? Can we build this infrastructure *and* stay within planetary freshwater allocation? Make trade-offs explicit—when they're forced, the parliament negotiates them with full transparency about who bears the cost. Amsterdam and Copenhagen have begun this; the accelerant is embedding Doughnut mapping into municipal planning cycles, requiring that every infrastructure project includes a doughnut impact assessment before approval.

**For activists and movements:** Use the Doughnut to reframe your demand set. Instead of only naming harms (overshoot), also name what an economy looks like that meets the social foundation for everyone. Build doughnut mapping into your own organizations' operations—if you're organizing for justice, your internal resource flows must demonstrate it. This creates credibility and models the transition you're asking for. Distribute the Doughnut mapping process itself as a tool to frontline communities so they can hold both states and corporations accountable against *local* versions of the safe and just space, not an external metric.

**For tech and product teams:** Embed doughnut impact metrics into your product development cycle. Define what "thriving for users and ecosystems" looks like: Does your product reduce screen dependency (social foundation) or increase it? Does it extract rare earth minerals (overshoot) or use recycled materials? Build feedback loops so users can see product impact in doughnut terms. Design for graceful degradation—your system should be designed to operate within planetary boundaries by default, not as an afterthought. This rewires the usual growth-at-any-cost velocity culture.

**Cross all contexts:** Create a quarterly ritual where the whole system—leadership, workers, communities of impact, ecological monitoring systems—gathers to resurvey the doughnut together. This is where the pattern lives or dies. Without this ritual, it becomes inert.

---

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

A shared language emerges where social and ecological vitality are no longer separate portfolios but integrated. Stakeholders who normally have no voice in economic decisions—residents, supply-chain workers, soil scientists—become designers with real authority. The pattern generates new legitimacy: organizations working toward a doughnut have lower employee churn, stronger community trust, and more stable supply networks because they're not running a predatory logic. Value creation shifts from extraction to regeneration; a supply network operating inside the doughnut learns to add back nitrogen rather than mine finite phosphorus. Decision speed often increases because people stop debating *whether* to honor boundaries and start innovating *how*.

**What risks emerge:**

Resilience and Ownership both score 3.0—watch for these failure modes. **Resilience decay:** The Doughnut can become ritual theater if the quarterly mapping cycles aren't backed by real decision-reshaping authority. Communities map out what they need, but nothing changes because finance or strategy holds veto power. The pattern becomes a pressure valve—giving voice without power. **Ownership collapse:** If the mapping process is driven by external consultants or top-down planners, it loses its commons character. People default to cynicism. **Composability risk (3.0):** Different parts of a large system create incompatible doughnuts—the product team's doughnut doesn't align with the supply chain's. Conflict multiplies without integrative mechanisms. Watch also for a subtle decay: *optimization within the doughnut* replacing *regeneration*. Organizations squeeze out every efficiency, hit their boundaries exactly, and call it done—but they've created a static system rather than a living one.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Amsterdam's Doughnut City initiative (2020–present):** The City of Amsterdam, with Kate Raworth's support, embedded the Doughnut into its city planning and economic strategy. They convened neighborhood assemblies to define what the social foundation looks like for Amsterdam residents—not theoretically, but by listening to what people lack. They mapped planetary boundaries specific to the city (carbon, materials, water). This shifted procurement: the city began favoring circular economy suppliers and insourcing waste management to keep nutrient loops local. The mapping revealed that Amsterdam's wealth extraction came largely from global finance and port logistics—activities that generated overshoot elsewhere. This sparked concrete redesigns: shifting subsidy from fossil-fuel industries toward regenerative food systems, reskilling port workers for offshore wind. The doughnut didn't solve everything, but it reframed what "prosperity" means in a city known for extraction.

**Raworth's own redesign of CASSE (Center for the Advancement of a Steady State Economy):** When organizations internalize this pattern, they often start with their own resource flows. Raworth worked with CASSE to redesign its funding model away from foundation grants (which lock in donor priorities) toward member-supported, regenerative financing. They mapped their own doughnut: employees earning living wages (social foundation) while operating on renewable energy and carbon-neutral operations (planetary boundaries). This wasn't a badge—it was a restructuring that eliminated positions that didn't serve the regenerative logic and created new roles around stakeholder convening.

**Intersectional Food Systems in Detroit:** Community organizations in Detroit have applied the Doughnut to food systems planning. They mapped a local doughnut: everyone has access to fresh food grown without synthetic inputs and grown by people earning dignified income (social foundation + planetary boundary). This moved their organizing from "food justice" as abstract value to specific redesigns: redirecting land from corporate agriculture toward community farms, creating procurement relationships between urban farmers and schools, and reshaping who owns and controls the food system. The doughnut became the map that held diverse actors (urban farmers, school districts, community health workers, indigenous seed keepers) accountable to shared boundaries.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age of AI and distributed intelligence, the Doughnut pattern faces new pressure and new possibility. **The pressure:** Machine-learning systems can now model doughnut trade-offs at scale—what happens to carbon if we increase health care access? What's the second-order ecological impact of electrifying transport? AI can surface hidden overshoot that humans miss (say, rare-earth mining for battery capacity). This tempts organizations to let algorithms *define* what "safe and just" means, replacing human contestation with machine optimization. This is the decay path: the Doughnut becomes just another optimization target, and the living negotiation of boundaries disappears.

**The leverage:** Distributed ledgers and sensor networks can make the Doughnut transparent in real time. A supply network using blockchain can map every node's impact—carbon, labor conditions, water use—creating radical transparency about where a product sits in the doughnut. Workers, communities, and supply partners can see live whether they're inside or outside the safe and just space. Participatory AI—systems designed for humans to contest and reshape together—can support the quarterly mapping process, surfacing patterns that the assembly might miss while keeping humans in the redesign authority. The tech context translation becomes: **Build products and systems whose architecture makes the doughnut visible and contestable, not optimized and hidden.**

AI also creates new overshoot risk: the energy intensity of large language models and data centers, the material extraction for GPU farms. Products claiming to be regenerative while running on computational infrastructure that's wildly beyond planetary boundaries are dishonest. The pattern must extend to measure and constrain the computational cost, not just the nominal product outcome.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

Observable doughnut vitality looks like: (1) Non-leadership stakeholders spontaneously raising doughnut-framed concerns in ordinary decision-making ("We can't hire for that role without raising our wage shortfall past safe space"); (2) Quarterly mapping sessions that generate visible resource reallocation—budget shifts, procurement changes, product retirements—that trace back to boundary crossings identified in the prior mapping cycle; (3) Friction becoming generative rather than hidden—conflicts about trade-offs are surfaced, named in doughnut terms, and resolved through negotiation rather than hierarchy imposing answers; (4) The system proactively naming where it's in overshoot and regeneration zones and explaining the lag in adjustment (not pretending it's already fixed).

**Signs of decay:**

Watch for: (1) The Doughnut exists in presentation decks but doesn't reshape actual budgets or authority; (2) Mapping cycles happen but lack real stakeholder diversity—mostly leadership and consultants, few workers or community members; (3) The organization celebrates staying "within" the doughnut without asking whether the boundaries were co-created or imposed; (4) Boundaries become static—the same metrics every year with no renegotiation, suggesting the map is no longer alive but ossified; (5) Conversations about the doughnut go silent among frontline workers, suggesting it's been appropriated as a leadership tool rather than a commons design.

**When to replant:**

Replant the pattern when you notice that boundary-crossing decisions are no longer being contested collectively—when the doughnut has become a passive metric rather than active navigation. This usually takes 18–24 months of routine mapping. Restart by convening a fresh assembly (include people who've rotated out), explicitly ask: *What has changed about what "thriving" means here? What have we learned about our actual boundaries?* Let the map breathe again.
