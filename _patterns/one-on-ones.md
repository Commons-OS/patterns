# One-on-Ones

### 1. Overview

One-on-one meetings, often abbreviated as 1-on-1s, are regularly scheduled, private conversations between a manager and a direct report. Their core purpose is to provide a dedicated space for open-ended and two-way communication, moving beyond the tactical status updates that dominate most other work interactions. These meetings are a foundational tool for effective leadership and people management, creating a consistent rhythm of connection that fosters trust, alignment, and mutual understanding. The primary problem this pattern solves is the communication gap that naturally emerges in hierarchical structures. Without a formal, recurring space for private dialogue, important issues can fester, feedback can be delayed or misconstrued, and employees can feel disconnected from their manager and the broader organization. This can lead to decreased engagement, lower productivity, and higher attrition. The concept of regular, private meetings between managers and their reports has evolved over decades of management theory, but it was significantly popularized in the modern tech industry by figures like Andy Grove at Intel, who detailed the practice in his influential book "High Output Management." Grove emphasized that a 1-on-1 should be the employee's meeting, with the manager's primary role being to listen and coach. In the context of commons-aligned value creation, one-on-ones are critical for building the high-trust, collaborative relationships that are the bedrock of a healthy commons. They provide a space to discuss not just individual performance, but also the health of the team, the alignment of individual work with the collective purpose, and the personal and professional growth of the individual within the community. By creating a space for authentic dialogue, 1-on-1s help to distribute power, foster psychological safety, and ensure that the needs and concerns of all members are heard and addressed, which are all essential for a thriving commons.

### 2. Core Principles

1.  **Employee-Driven Agenda:** The meeting should be owned by the direct report, not the manager. The employee sets the agenda and speaks first, ensuring their most pressing issues, questions, and ideas are prioritized.
2.  **Consistent Cadence:** The meetings must be regularly scheduled and consistently honored. A predictable rhythm, typically weekly or bi-weekly, builds trust and makes the conversations a natural part of the workflow rather than a special event.
3.  **Focus on the Human:** While work is discussed, the primary focus is on the person. The conversation should cover career aspirations, professional development, personal well-being, and feedback in both directions, fostering a holistic and supportive relationship.
4.  **Psychological Safety:** The meeting is a confidential and safe space for honest conversation. Both parties should feel comfortable raising difficult topics, admitting mistakes, and expressing vulnerability without fear of reprisal.
5.  **Two-Way Feedback:** One-on-ones are a critical channel for both giving and receiving feedback. It's an opportunity for managers to coach and guide, and for employees to provide upward feedback on what's working and what's not.
6.  **Action-Oriented Outcomes:** The conversation should lead to clear takeaways and commitments. Both the manager and the employee should leave with a shared understanding of next steps, whether it's removing a blocker, exploring a development opportunity, or making a specific change.

### 3. Key Practices

1.  **Shared Agenda Document:** Create a collaborative document where both the manager and the employee can add agenda items in advance. This ensures both parties come prepared and the time is used effectively.
2.  **Start with a Personal Check-in:** Begin the meeting by asking "How are you?" and genuinely listening to the answer. This helps to build rapport and understand the employee's state of mind before diving into work topics.
3.  **Go Beyond Status Updates:** Actively steer the conversation away from a simple recitation of tasks. Use open-ended questions to explore challenges, motivations, and aspirations. For example, ask "What's on your mind?" or "What are you most excited about?"
4.  **Practice Active Listening:** The manager's primary role is to listen. Avoid interrupting, ask clarifying questions, and summarize what you've heard to ensure understanding. The goal is to understand, not just to respond.
5.  **Discuss Career Growth:** Regularly dedicate time to discuss the employee's long-term career goals and how their current role can support them. This shows a commitment to their development and increases engagement.
6.  **Give and Solicit Specific Feedback:** Provide timely and specific feedback, both positive and constructive. Also, actively ask for feedback on your own performance as a manager, such as "What can I do to better support you?"
7.  **Take Notes and Track Commitments:** Document key discussion points, decisions, and action items. This creates a record of the conversation and ensures that commitments are followed up on.
8.  **Never Cancel, Only Reschedule:** Protect the scheduled time for one-on-ones. Canceling sends a message that the employee is not a priority. If a conflict is unavoidable, reschedule promptly.

### 4. Implementation

Implementing one-on-ones effectively requires a conscious and deliberate approach. The first step is to establish a regular, recurring schedule and communicate the purpose and structure of these meetings to your team. A 30-minute meeting every week is a good starting point for most employees, though this can be adjusted based on individual needs. It's crucial to emphasize that this is the employee's meeting and that they are expected to come prepared with an agenda. To facilitate this, create a simple, shared document (e.g., a Google Doc or a dedicated tool) where both the manager and the employee can add topics for discussion. The manager should review the agenda beforehand and come prepared to listen, ask thoughtful questions, and offer support. During the meeting, the manager should let the employee lead the conversation, guiding it with open-ended questions that encourage reflection and dialogue. A good structure to follow is to start with a personal check-in, then move to the employee's agenda items, and finally, cover any topics the manager needs to discuss.

Key considerations for successful implementation include creating a culture of trust and psychological safety. This means treating the conversations as confidential and responding with empathy and support, especially when employees share challenges or vulnerabilities. It's also important to be consistent. Skipping or frequently rescheduling one-on-ones undermines their value and erodes trust. A real-world example of effective implementation can be seen at companies like Atlassian and Google, where one-on-ones are a cornerstone of their management philosophy. A manager at Atlassian might start a 1-on-1 by asking, "What was the highlight of your week?" and "What was the lowlight?" These simple questions can open the door to deeper conversations about what's energizing and what's frustrating the employee. The manager would then listen intently, ask follow-up questions to understand the root cause of any issues, and work with the employee to find solutions. Over time, this consistent practice builds a strong, trusting relationship that enables both the employee and the team to thrive.

### 5. 7 Pillars Assessment

| Pillar | Score (1-5) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | 4 | One-on-ones strongly align with a shared purpose by creating a space to connect individual work to the larger mission and values of the organization. They help ensure that everyone is pulling in the same direction. |
| Governance | 3 | While not a formal governance structure, one-on-ones contribute to more distributed and participatory governance by creating a channel for upward feedback and giving employees a voice in decisions that affect them. |
| Culture | 5 | This pattern is a powerful driver of a high-trust, collaborative, and psychologically safe culture. It fosters open communication, mutual respect, and a sense of belonging, which are all hallmarks of a healthy commons. |
| Incentives | 3 | One-on-ones can help to align incentives by providing a space to discuss what motivates individuals and how their contributions can be recognized and rewarded in ways that are meaningful to them. |
| Knowledge | 4 | These meetings are a key mechanism for knowledge sharing, both explicit and tacit. They facilitate the transfer of information, skills, and context between managers and employees, and help to surface hidden knowledge within the team. |
| Technology | N/A | This pattern is primarily a social technology, not a technical one. While tools can be used to schedule and document one-on-ones, the pattern itself is about human interaction. |
| Resilience | 4 | By building strong relationships and fostering open communication, one-on-ones increase the resilience of the team and the organization. They help to surface and address problems early, before they become crises. |
| **Overall** | **4.0** | **One-on-ones are a highly effective pattern for building the social fabric of a commons-aligned organization. They foster trust, collaboration, and a sense of shared purpose, which are essential for long-term health and resilience.** |

### 6. When to Use

*   In any organization with a hierarchical management structure, to mitigate the communication gaps and power imbalances inherent in that structure.
*   When you want to increase employee engagement, satisfaction, and retention.
*   When you need to build a culture of trust, psychological safety, and open communication.
*   When you want to foster the professional development and career growth of your team members.
*   In remote or distributed teams, where regular, intentional connection is even more critical.
*   During times of change or uncertainty, to provide a stable and supportive space for employees to process their concerns.

### 7. Anti-Patterns and Gotchas

*   **The Status Update:** The most common anti-pattern is using the one-on-one as a simple status report. This is a waste of valuable, synchronous time. Status updates can be handled asynchronously.
*   **The Manager's Monologue:** The meeting is dominated by the manager, who uses the time to lecture, delegate tasks, or talk about their own priorities. The employee has little opportunity to speak.
*   **The Inconsistent Cadence:** The meetings are frequently canceled, rescheduled, or skipped. This sends a message that the employee is not a priority and undermines the trust the meetings are meant to build.
*   **Lack of Preparation:** Both the manager and the employee come to the meeting unprepared, with no agenda or topics for discussion. This leads to a shallow, unproductive conversation.
*   **Avoiding Difficult Conversations:** The meeting stays on safe, superficial topics, and important issues like performance problems, interpersonal conflicts, or career dissatisfaction are avoided.
*   **No Follow-up:** The conversation is good, but there are no clear action items or commitments at the end. The same issues are discussed week after week with no progress.
