# WikiHouse (Open Source Housing)

## 1. Overview

WikiHouse is an open-source construction system that aims to radically simplify the way we design, manufacture, and assemble high-performance buildings. By leveraging digital fabrication and a distributed network of manufacturers, WikiHouse empowers individuals and communities to build their own beautiful, sustainable, and affordable homes. The core of the WikiHouse system is a library of 3D models for wooden building components, which can be downloaded, customized, and then cut with precision using a CNC machine. These components are designed to be easily assembled by a small team of people, often without the need for traditional construction skills or heavy machinery. This approach to construction not only has the potential to make housing more accessible and affordable but also to create a more resilient and sustainable built environment. By open-sourcing the technology and building a global community of contributors, WikiHouse is fostering a new paradigm for the construction industry, one that is more democratic, collaborative, and in tune with the needs of the 21st century.


## 2. Core Principles

The WikiHouse project is built upon a set of core principles that guide its development and application. These principles are not merely technical guidelines but represent a philosophical shift in how we think about housing, community, and the environment.

**1. Open and Shared:** At its heart, WikiHouse is an open-source project. All designs, software, and hardware specifications are shared under a Creative Commons license, allowing anyone to use, adapt, and improve upon them. This open approach fosters a global community of contributors who are constantly innovating and refining the system, ensuring that it remains resilient, adaptable, and accessible to all.

**2. Digital and Distributed:** WikiHouse leverages the power of digital fabrication to create a distributed manufacturing network. Instead of relying on a single, centralized factory, WikiHouse components can be produced by a network of local CNC fabricators. This not only reduces transportation costs and environmental impact but also supports local economies and creates a more resilient supply chain.

**3. Simple and Accessible:** The WikiHouse system is designed to be simple enough for almost anyone to assemble, regardless of their construction experience. The components are lightweight and slot together using a system of interlocking joints, eliminating the need for complex tools or heavy machinery. This focus on accessibility empowers individuals and communities to take control of their own housing needs.

**4. Sustainable and High-Performing:** Sustainability is a fundamental principle of the WikiHouse system. The use of timber, a renewable and carbon-sequestering material, combined with high-performance insulation and a focus on airtightness, results in buildings that are not only low-carbon but also highly energy-efficient. This commitment to sustainability extends to the entire lifecycle of the building, from design and construction to operation and eventual deconstruction.

**5. Designed for People and Planet:** The ultimate goal of WikiHouse is to create homes and communities that are good for both people and the planet. This means designing buildings that are not only beautiful, functional, and affordable but also contribute to a more sustainable and equitable future. By putting the tools and knowledge of construction into the hands of ordinary people, WikiHouse is helping to create a world where everyone has the opportunity to live in a home that they have helped to create.


## 3. Key Practices

WikiHouse is not just a set of principles; it is a practical system for building. The following key practices are the essential activities that bring the WikiHouse vision to life.

**Digital Design and Customization:** The process begins with digital design. Users can access a library of pre-designed building components and templates, which they can then customize to meet their specific needs and preferences. This is typically done using accessible 3D modeling software, such as SketchUp. This digital-first approach allows for a high degree of flexibility and personalization, enabling users to create unique homes that are tailored to their site and lifestyle.

**CNC Fabrication:** Once the design is finalized, the 3D models are converted into cutting files that can be sent to a CNC (Computer Numerical Control) router. This machine then automatically cuts the building components from standard sheets of plywood or other engineered wood products. The precision of the CNC cutting process ensures that every component is made to exact specifications, which is crucial for the subsequent assembly process.

**On-site Assembly:** The cut components are then delivered to the construction site, where they can be assembled by a small team of people. The components are designed to be lightweight and easy to handle, and they slot together using a system of interlocking joints, similar to a jigsaw puzzle. This assembly process typically does not require specialized construction skills or heavy machinery, making it accessible to a wide range of people.

**Community Collaboration:** The open-source nature of WikiHouse fosters a vibrant and collaborative community of users, designers, engineers, and builders. This community plays a vital role in the ongoing development of the system, contributing new designs, sharing knowledge and best practices, and providing support to fellow WikiHouse builders. This collaborative ecosystem is essential for the resilience and long-term success of the project.


## 4. Application Context

WikiHouse is a versatile system that can be adapted to a wide range of applications, from individual homes to community buildings and disaster relief housing. Its modular and scalable nature makes it suitable for a variety of contexts, both urban and rural.

**Self-build Housing:** One of the primary applications of WikiHouse is for self-build housing projects. The simplicity of the assembly process and the accessibility of the design tools empower individuals and families to build their own homes, often at a fraction of the cost of a conventional house. This can be a particularly attractive option for those who are struggling to get on the property ladder or who want to create a home that is tailored to their specific needs and values.

**Community-led Projects:** WikiHouse is also well-suited for community-led housing projects. The collaborative nature of the system and the potential for skills-sharing make it an ideal tool for co-housing groups, community land trusts, and other organizations that are working to create affordable and sustainable housing for their communities.

**Disaster Relief and Emergency Housing:** The speed and ease of assembly of the WikiHouse system make it a promising solution for disaster relief and emergency housing. In the aftermath of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake or a hurricane, WikiHouse structures can be quickly deployed to provide safe and secure shelter for those who have been displaced.

**Custom and Bespoke Buildings:** While WikiHouse provides a standardized system of components, it also allows for a high degree of customization. This makes it possible to create a wide range of building types, from small cabins and studios to larger family homes and even public buildings. The flexibility of the system allows architects and designers to create unique and innovative buildings that respond to the specific needs of their clients and the context of the site.


## 5. Implementation

Implementing a WikiHouse project involves a series of steps, from initial conception to the final assembly. While the process is designed to be accessible, it still requires careful planning and coordination. The following is a typical workflow for a WikiHouse build.

**1. Define Your Project:** The first step is to define the scope and requirements of your project. This includes determining the size and layout of the building, identifying the site, and establishing a budget. It is also important to research local building codes and regulations to ensure that your project will be compliant.

**2. Design Your WikiHouse:** Once you have a clear vision for your project, you can begin the design process. This can be done using the WikiHouse design tools and library of components, or by working with an architect or designer who is familiar with the system. The design process is an opportunity to customize your home to your specific needs and preferences, while also ensuring that it is structurally sound and energy-efficient.

**3. Find a Local Manufacturer:** With the design complete, the next step is to find a local CNC fabricator who can produce the WikiHouse components. The WikiHouse website provides a directory of registered manufacturers, but you can also search for local CNC workshops in your area. It is important to work closely with the manufacturer to ensure that they have the correct files and materials to produce the components to the required specifications.

**4. Prepare the Site and Foundations:** While the components are being manufactured, you can prepare the construction site. This includes clearing and leveling the ground, and constructing the foundations for the building. The type of foundation will depend on the specific site conditions and the design of the building.

**5. Assemble the Frame:** Once the components have been delivered to the site, the assembly process can begin. The lightweight, interlocking components are designed to be assembled by a small team of people, without the need for heavy machinery. The assembly process is typically very fast, with the main frame of the building often being erected in just a few days.

**6. Finishing and Services:** With the main frame in place, the final step is to finish the building. This includes installing the cladding, insulation, windows, and doors, as well as the electrical, plumbing, and heating systems. This stage of the process may require the assistance of professional tradespeople, depending on your skills and experience.
