Beauty and body standards are not natural but constructed to maintain power; questioning them is political.

### Section 1: Context

In organizations, movements, public systems, and digital platforms, bodies move through space — they're hired, photographed, measured, coded, trained. The standards governing which bodies "fit," succeed, belong, or get centered are presented as neutral, objective, or simply "professional." This appearance of naturalness is precisely where power invisibly hardens. Within intrapreneurship — where people build new ventures, initiatives, and value systems inside or alongside institutions — body standards operate as a quiet filter. They shape who feels safe enough to speak in meetings, whose image gets used in marketing, whose physical presence is coded as "leadership material," whose labor is invisible.

The tension is acute because intrapreneurs must navigate existing institutional norms while simultaneously reimagining what's possible. They cannot ignore body standards (they're embedded in hiring, culture, visibility), yet they cannot flourish by simply reproducing them. Commons-stewarded spaces — whether a new departmental initiative, a civic body, a movement infrastructure, or an algorithmic system — have a unique opening: they can make visible what was hidden, name whose bodies are centered, and actively redesign the standards themselves rather than inherit them. The ecosystem is currently fragmenting between those who reinforce beauty and body norms for control, and those who resist them for autonomy. Commons sit in the generative middle: stewarding whose bodies are genuinely valued, visible, and centered in the value creation process.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is The vs. Standards.**

One force operates from assumption: bodies are naturally variable, yet institutions require standardization for efficiency, trust, and control. This logic drives "professional appearance" codes, beauty filters in recruitment platforms, ergonomic norms designed for a fictional average body, and algorithmic training data that encodes dominant body types. These standards feel invisible because they're everywhere. They sort people silently — some bodies pass; others are constantly calibrated, judged, or excluded.

The opposing force is lived difference: not all bodies fit the standard, and many never will. Some bodies are disabled, neurodivergent, fat, visibly racialized, or simply refuse the labor of conforming. When standards are treated as natural law, these bodies become problems to fix rather than signals that the standard itself is broken. The tension breaks down trust, creates surveillance of bodies rather than stewardship of people, and causes real bodies to exhaust themselves conforming while their actual contribution goes unrecognized.

For commons practitioners, the stakes are highest here. If a commons reproduces inherited body standards without naming them, it replicates the power dynamics it claims to transform. If it ignores standards entirely, it leaves them operating underground where they're harder to shift. The real work is *political consciousness*: making visible whose aesthetic, physical presence, and embodied labor are centered and valued; asking *why* those choices were made; and redesigning the standards themselves through collective deliberation rather than individual conformity.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, commons practitioners audit whose bodies are actually centered in their spaces, name the standards operating (often invisibly), and collectively redesign them through deliberate choice rather than inherited assumption.**

This pattern works by making the invisible visible and then treating it as a design question, not a nature question. The mechanism has three moves:

*First, the audit.* Walk through your commons — literally and metaphorically. Whose images appear in communications? Whose physical presence is assumed in meeting spaces, tools, and workflows? What body types appear in leadership, visibility, decision-making? What happens to bodies that don't fit: disabled access, neurodivergent rhythm, different aesthetic, different energy? The audit is not accusatory; it's diagnostic. You're mapping the current standard. In critical body studies, this is called "reading the room" — understanding which bodies feel at home and which are being subtly, constantly adjusted.

*Second, naming.* Bring the standard into language. Say: "We've been centering a particular body type in our marketing — young, thin, able-bodied, certain ethnicities." Or: "Our meeting rhythm assumes a body that can sit still for two hours." Or: "Our product interface was designed without testing with disabled users." This naming is an act of commons stewardship because it shifts the standard from natural law to collective choice. It creates the possibility of changing it.

*Third, redesign through deliberation.* Whose voices must be in the room to choose new standards? People whose bodies have been marginalised by the old ones. This isn't tokenism; it's epistemic justice — the bodies that have been optimised-out of the system hold knowledge the system has lost. A commons asks: What would we value if we centred fat bodies, disabled bodies, racialized bodies, queer bodies? What new capacities emerge? What does leadership look like? What pace? What aesthetic? This redesign renews the system's vitality by incorporating the knowledge embedded in marginalised bodies.

The pattern sustains commons because it names power explicitly — the core work of co-ownership — and distributes the authority to change standards rather than leaving it concentrated in default institutional logic.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**For corporate intrapreneurship:** Convene a cross-functional body standards audit. Include people from hiring, design, marketing, and operations. Spend two hours walking through: job descriptions (what body is assumed?), office layouts (who can access all spaces?), marketing materials (which bodies appear, in what roles?), hiring interviews (are there unstated aesthetic judgments?), meeting norms (whose bodies can participate fully?). Name three inherited standards you're reproducing. Then: redesign one concretely. If hiring has unconsciously centered a certain body type, rewrite the job description to specify what's truly required versus what's preference-bias. If marketing always shows young, thin bodies, commit to a percentage target for body diversity in the next campaign and hire a photographer trained in disability-aware imaging. Set a review point in three months.

**For government and public service:** Establish a body standards working group within your agency or department. Map whose bodies are visible in public-facing materials (websites, campaigns, public events), whose are assumed in policy design (single-parent bodies, disabled bodies, aging bodies, racialized bodies), and whose are missing. Conduct interviews with people whose bodies don't fit your default: ask them how your systems fail them specifically. Then redesign one policy or public process. If your civic engagement events assume everyone can stand for two hours, add seating, move breaks, offer virtual participation. If your website is inaccessible to screen readers, fix it — this isn't an accommodation, it's a basic standard redesign. Publish what you learned so other agencies can iterate.

**For activist movements:** Make body standards an explicit organizing question, not a taboo. In your movement spaces, ask: Whose bodies do we center as leaders, speakers, face of the movement? Are fat bodies, disabled bodies, trans bodies, Black bodies, brown bodies, older bodies, neurodivergent bodies equally visible and trusted with power? Run a 360-degree feedback process: ask movement members anonymously whether they've felt excluded or hypervisible based on their body. Then collectively design new norms: How many speakers of different body types in the next public event? What accessibility do we commit to? What aesthetic do we amplify? Make this visible in your communications — show that you chose differently.

**For tech and product:** Audit your training data. If your product (recommendation algorithms, hiring tools, dating apps, content moderation) was trained on dominant-culture body images, it will perpetuate those standards at scale. Document what bodies your system was trained on and what it optimises for. Then: diversify your training data intentionally. Test your product with disabled users, fat users, visibly racialized users, trans users — before launch, not as an afterthought. If your product uses computer vision, test it on a range of bodies; if it uses language models, audit for bias in descriptions of bodies. When you find gaps, fix them in the code. Document the change publicly — this signals to users that you made a deliberate choice about whose bodies your system values.

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

New adaptive capacity emerges because the commons stops inheriting standards and starts designing them. Teams develop literacy in spotting power dynamics they previously missed. Trust deepens because people experience their bodies as genuinely included, not merely tolerated. Marginalized practitioners — those whose bodies have been optimised-out — begin contributing their full intelligence because they're no longer managing the exhaustion of conformity. Marketing, design, and policy improve because they're no longer built on false assumptions about a fictional average body. The system becomes more resilient to diversity because it was consciously designed for it rather than accidentally sorted by it.

**What risks emerge:**

The pattern scores 3.0 on resilience, ownership, and autonomy — the lowest domains. This signals real risks. First: *routinization and hollowing.* Once a body standards audit is done, it's easy to declare victory and move on. The pattern can become a checkbox ("we're diverse") that masks unchanged power dynamics underground. Watch for this: if people report that standards haven't actually shifted in daily life, you've lost the thread. Second: *backlash and culture war dynamics.* Naming that beauty standards are constructed — not natural — triggers defensive reactions in people invested in the old standards. The commons can fracture if this conversation isn't held with genuine curiosity about why the old standards felt safe to people. Third: *incomplete redesign.* Redesigning one public standard (marketing images) while leaving hiring standards unchanged creates confusion and retraumatization. The pattern requires systemic redesign, not symbolic gesture, or vitality decays quickly. Fourth: *ownership diffusion.* If the commons doesn't stay actively stewarding the new standards (through review, adjustment, recommitment), they atrophy and old patterns creep back in.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Disability justice organizing in U.S. movements (2010s–present).** Disability justice practitioners — Patty Berne, Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha, and others — made visible that activist spaces were centering able bodies without naming it: long meetings assuming mobility, loud spaces assuming hearing, face-to-face meetings assuming vision. They audited what was happening, named it ("ableism in our own movements"), and redesigned norms. They insisted on access as standard practice: ASL interpreters, scent-free spaces, rest areas, flexible participation. This wasn't an add-on; it was a redesign of what "active participation" meant. The commons result: disabled people became recognized strategists and leaders, not accommodated guests. The movement became more creative and resilient because it incorporated disabled bodies' knowledge about how systems fail.

**Lean In and beauty standards pushback (2010s–present).** Corporate diversity initiatives initially centered on "helping women succeed in existing structures" — which implicitly meant adopting masculine presentation norms, thinness, professional beauty standards. Some companies (notably some tech firms) began auditing this: whose bodies were centered in leadership imagery? What aesthetic was coded as "professional"? Some deliberately redesigned: showing leaders in more varied body types, ages, and aesthetics; removing makeup or fashion requirements from "professional" codes; centering competence over appearance. The commons result: teams reported less exhaustion around appearance management and more bandwidth for actual work. Retention improved, particularly for women who'd previously felt they had to choose between authenticity and advancement.

**Open-source design and user testing with disabled bodies (2010s–present).** Software projects like WordPress, WCAG accessibility standards, and disability-led tech initiatives began treating "user testing with disabled people" as a core standard, not an afterthought. They audited: whose bodies did our interface design assume? They named: "We designed for sighted, hearing, able-bodied users only." Then they redesigned: blind users tested navigation, deaf users tested video, disabled users tested everything. The commons result: products became better for everyone (curb cuts principle), because the standards expanded rather than shrunk. Communities of disabled developers became recognized contributors; the field gained competence it was missing.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age of algorithmic decision-making, body standards operate at a new scale and invisibility. AI systems that sort, recommend, hire, and approve are trained on historical data that encodes centuries of body-based discrimination. A hiring algorithm trained on "successful employees" will learn and amplify the body types, ethnicities, and presentations of people already in power. A content recommendation algorithm trained on engagement metrics will learn to center which bodies generate clicks — often reproducing beauty hierarchies at scale.

The tech context translation becomes critical here: *The Politics of Body Standards for Products.* Practitioners must audit training data explicitly, name the bodies their AI systems were and weren't trained on, and redesign with intention. This is new work: not just hiring diverse teams, but ensuring training datasets include disabled bodies, fat bodies, racialized bodies, aging bodies. It means testing AI systems on these bodies before deployment — this is a form of commons stewardship at scale.

The leverage point is high because code enforces standards faster and more invisibly than human bias alone. A biased hiring algorithm can sort thousands of candidates per day; a biased human hiring manager can only interview dozens. This means fixing algorithmic body standards is high-impact but also high-stakes: if the fix is superficial (adding diverse images to training data without actually reweighting what the model values), the commons can generate new forms of discrimination disguised as inclusion.

The new risk: *aesthetic manipulation at scale.* As generative AI produces images, it becomes possible to manufacture "diverse" marketing materials without actually centering diverse bodies in decision-making. A commons must stay vigilant: Are we using AI to genuinely redesign whose bodies are valued, or to perform diversity while keeping power the same?

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

People from previously marginalised body types report feeling less exhausted in the commons space — they're not constantly managing conformity. Leadership, visibility, and key roles include a genuine range of body types, ages, abilities, and aesthetics (not tokenism — it's normal). When new standards are questioned, there's collective deliberation, not defensive justification ("that's just how things are"). The commons revisits body standards deliberately — every 6–12 months, not as a one-time audit but as ongoing stewardship. Members from marginalised bodies are specifically asked for their intelligence and observations; their voices shape redesign, not just rubber-stamp approval.

**Signs of decay:**

The audit was completed but nothing changed in daily practice — it became symbolic. People report that standards are "more diverse" in marketing materials but haven't shifted in hiring, meeting norms, or who holds power. Conversations about body standards trigger defensive reactions ("why are we making this political?") instead of genuine curiosity. Disabled or fat or otherwise marginalised people are invited to "input" on standards but not trusted with redesign authority; they feel consulted, not co-owning. The commons has outsourced this work to a DEI consultant or committee that doesn't have real power to redesign, so nothing systemic shifts. Months pass without the commons returning to the question — it fades to background.

**When to replant:**

Replant this pattern when you sense the commons is reproducing inherited standards without naming them — when bodies are being sorted by invisible criteria rather than stewarded through collective choice. The right moment is often when someone from a marginalised body type names exhaustion or exclusion. Listen to that signal as an invitation to audit again, not as a problem to manage. The pattern is designed for renewal, not one-time deployment; expect to return to it every 12–18 months as the commons evolves.
