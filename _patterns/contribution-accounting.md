Developing fair, transparent systems for recognising and balancing different types of contribution to a Commons — financial, intellectual, relational, operational — so that co-ownership reflects actual value creation.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Commons Governance / Economics.

---

### Section 1: Context

Most Commons begin with clarity: a founding group contributes energy, capital, or vision. Then growth muddies it. New members arrive with different capacities. Some contribute cash; others bring networks, skill, or steady operational work. A cooperative grows from 8 to 80 members. A movement scales from local to regional. An open-source product gains maintainers, translators, and evangelists who are not coders. A public service broadens its stakeholder base.

At this threshold, two things happen simultaneously: co-ownership becomes both more vital (because the system is no longer small enough for handshake agreements) and harder to justify (because "who actually built this?" becomes genuinely ambiguous). The system fragments into visible and invisible tiers. Financial contributors feel entitled. Unpaid relational workers feel erased. Long-term operational stewards resent new money-bringers. The commons begins to smell like extraction dressed as inclusion.

This pattern emerges because living systems require honest accounting to maintain legitimacy. Without it, trust decays into resentment, and co-ownership becomes fiction. The system stagnates not from lack of contribution, but from contribution being unrecognised, misweighted, or invisible.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Contribution vs. Accounting.**

Contribution wants to flow freely: people give what they have, when they have it, without calculating return. This is the gift economy impulse. It builds resilience and attracts diversity. It asks: *What does the system need right now?*

Accounting wants precision: who gave what, when, measured against what standard, entitling them to what share? This is the stewardship impulse. It prevents drift and protects co-owners. It asks: *Who built this and how much do they own?*

Neither side is wrong. Left unresolved, the tension produces three failure modes:

**Mode 1: Invisible work.** Relational labour (meeting-holding, conflict-tending, knowledge-transfer, trust-building) vanishes from records because it's unmeasurable. Financial contributors dominate because money is quantifiable. The commons becomes a hired-hand operation, not a shared endeavour.

**Mode 2: Rigid entitlement.** Once you try to account for everything, you must define units: hours, dollars, points, impact-scores. Rigidity sets in. Contribution becomes transactional. The grace of mutuality hardens into contract. Autonomy (score: 3.0) and resilience (score: 3.0) both suffer — people optimize for the metric, not the work.

**Mode 3: Obscured power.** Without accounting, whoever controls narrative controls credit. Founders claim intellectual work others did. Financiers claim ownership of relational infrastructure others built. The system fragments into visible and invisible power structures, and co-ownership becomes opaque.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, establish a living contribution registry that names multiple contribution types, weights them by stakeholder agreement, audits them regularly, and ties them explicitly to ownership rights.**

This pattern works because it moves contribution from hidden to visible without turning it into rigid transaction. A contribution registry is like the nutrient cycle in a forest: it names what flows in and out, which transforms invisible exchange into knowable exchange.

The mechanism has three keystone moves:

**First: pluralise what counts.** Instead of "Did you pay?" expand to: *Did you fund, code, design, strategise, organise, teach, translate, tend relationships, hold containers, maintain systems, or bring networks?* Name the contribution types your commons actually depends on. This surfaces invisible work immediately. Relational stewardship becomes real.

**Second: weight by agreement, not decree.** Don't impose a universal hours-to-equity conversion. Instead, gather your co-owners and ask: *In our system, right now, what matters most?* Perhaps: intellectual work (40%), operational continuity (25%), financial risk (20%), relational binding (15%). These weights shift as the system's needs shift. Autonomy grows because members co-author the measure.

**Third: audit, don't police.** Once quarterly or semi-annually, review the registry. *Are we seeing what we think we're seeing? Does the recorded contribution match our lived experience?* This is an act of collective sense-making, not forensic audit. It catches drift early — when a founder is hoarding credit, when invisible workers are burning out, when new members feel excluded.

The registry is a living artefact: it grows with the commons, records real contribution, and stays connected to actual power distribution. It dissolves the fiction that co-ownership can exist without measurement, while resisting the trap that measurement must be mechanical.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**Step 1: Name your contribution types.** Gather your core stewardship circle. Spend 2–3 hours mapping: *What work actually happens here?* For a cooperative, this might be: capital investment, sweat equity, operational continuity, customer relationships, strategic thinking. For a movement, it might be: fundraising, training, communications, ground presence, coalition-building. For an open-source project, it might be: code, design, documentation, community moderation, infrastructure. For a public service, it might be: policy expertise, frontline delivery, stakeholder trust-building, data stewardship. Write them down. Make them visible. This is your vocabulary of value.

**Step 2: Build the registry.** Create a simple, transparent document (spreadsheet or lightweight tool — not heavy enterprise software). Columns: contributor name, contribution type(s), time period, specific work, notes. Add a row for each significant contribution. Keep it boring and factual. *"Alice: strategic thinking. Oct–Dec. Designed commons governance model. 60 hours estimated."* The point is accuracy and clarity, not performance. Update it monthly.

**Step 3: Establish weights through deliberation.** Convene your membership (or representative body). Present your contribution types. Ask: *If we had 100 units of ownership to distribute, how much would each type deserve?* This is not arithmetic — it's values conversation. Activist communities often weight relational work higher than corporate contexts do. Tech communities sometimes undervalue operations until systems break. Deliberate. Disagree. Converge. Document the weights. Make them live in the registry as metadata: *"In this cycle, code = 0.4, operations = 0.25, fundraising = 0.2, community-building = 0.15."*

**Step 4: Calculate holdings quarterly.** At the end of each quarter, calculate: *For each contributor, sum their contributions across all types, apply the weights, derive their current ownership stake.* This isn't a one-time dividend; it's a running record. Some commons use this to inform governance voting rights. Some use it to distribute profit-sharing. Some use it only for transparency and legitimacy. Decide what the calculation is *for* — then use it consistently.

**Step 5: Audit for alignment.** Every quarter or semi-annually, reconvene stewards and review: *Does the registry match our lived experience? Are we seeing contributions we missed? Are we weight-balancing fairly?* This is where rigidity gets caught early. If you see that technical work is being credited at 100 hours when actual investment was 40, adjust. If relational work is being recorded as invisible, move it into view. This step prevents the registry from becoming a dead artifact.

**Corporate translation:** Contribution Accounting for Organizations works when you name non-financial contributions alongside salary and investment. A product manager's market insight, a designer's aesthetic influence, a facilitator's team cohesion — weight and record these alongside equity stakes. This prevents financiers from owning narrative entirely.

**Government translation:** In Public Service, contribution accounting names the work done by elected officials, permanent staff, community advisors, and citizens differently. A teacher's daily presence, a policy officer's expertise, a community leader's trust-building — each entitles them to different kinds of voice in decisions. This prevents permanent bureaucrats from invisibly owning systems designed as public commons.

**Activist translation:** For Movements, contribution accounting honors the work done by fundraisers, organizers, trainers, communicators, and frontline participants. A 20-hour organizer and a 5-hour door-knocker both contributed. The registry names this without demanding equality. This prevents invisible hierarchies from hardening.

**Tech translation:** For Products (especially open-source), contribution accounting moves beyond commit-counting. A translator's 200 strings, a documenter's migration guide, a community moderator's conflict tending, a funder's infrastructure — record them all. This prevents engineer-centric metrics from erasing the commons that makes code valuable.

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

Co-ownership becomes legible. Members see themselves and each other in the record. Invisible workers feel seen; this alone reduces burnout and increases commitment. Trust rises because the system is no longer opaque. Decision-making can now be genuinely distributed, because people can point to the registry and say: *"Yes, I contributed here; I have standing in this choice."* 

Diversity of contribution naturally follows. When you create space for relational, operational, and intellectual work alongside financial, you attract people who don't have capital but have skills and care. The commons becomes more resilient to financial shocks because it's built on multiple contribution types, not just money.

New members know how to participate. The registry becomes an onboarding tool: *Here's how people contribute here. Here's what we weight. This is how you might fit in.*

**What risks emerge:**

**Rigidity and gaming.** If the registry becomes doctrine, people optimize for the metric. They pad hours, claim credit for relational work they didn't do, or exclude contributions that don't fit boxes. Watch for: people reporting time instead of doing work; members arguing about categorization instead of deepening contribution; the system becoming bureaucratic instead of alive.

**Resilience hazard (score: 3.0).** Contribution accounting maintains existing health but doesn't generate adaptive capacity. In crisis, when the commons must rapidly evolve, a rigid registry becomes a constraint. People might follow the old rules instead of adapting. Design your registry to be redesigned — quarterly weight-adjustments, not annual locks.

**Autonomy tension (score: 3.0).** The act of measuring can shrink autonomy even as it aims to protect it. Some members will feel constrained by categories. Some will resent being "scored." Build in regular opt-outs or redesign moments. Let people say: *"I don't want to be registered; I just want to contribute."* Honor that, even if it means they have less formal standing.

**False precision.** A registry can mask the impossibility of perfect accounting. Relational work is still hard to measure honestly. Don't let the tool seduce you into thinking you've solved the fundamental unmeasurability of care. Stay humble.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Mondragon Cooperatives (Spain, since 1956).** Mondragon's worker-owned manufacturing federation tracks contribution through membership dues (all members pay equally), work hours (recorded in operational systems), and governance participation (tracked through meeting attendance and committee roles). They weight financial contribution (payment of capital) heavily at entry, but operational and relational contribution (skill-building, mentorship, conflict resolution) heavily in promotion and profit-distribution decisions. This multi-axis accounting has allowed them to maintain co-ownership across 80,000+ members and 200+ cooperatives. When members feel invisible, Mondragon convenes to re-weight. This is why they've survived five decades while most worker-owned enterprises dissolve after 10 years.

**Linux Kernel Development (open-source, ongoing).** The kernel project doesn't use a formal registry, but maintainers practice implicit contribution accounting. Linus Torvalds credits subsystem maintainers by name in releases; maintainers credit patch authors; documentation leads are visible in changelogs. This naming practice creates a transparent hierarchy of contribution: a core maintainer has more standing than a one-time patch author. New contributors see exactly how to gain credibility. When contributors felt erased (early 2000s), the community consciously moved to better credit practices, adding contributor tags and updating commit standards. This prevented a brain drain of non-core contributors.

**Transition Towns Movement (UK/global, since 2006).** Transition Towns use contribution circles that track (informally but deliberately) financial donations, volunteer hours, facilitation leadership, and relationship-weaving. In a town like Totnes, the core team maintains a simple shared document naming who brought what: seed funding, meeting space, media relations, training delivery, conflict-holding. When newer members asked "who decides?" the answer was: *"Look at the contribution map — you can see who's been holding this."* This prevented the emergence of invisible power brokers. It also surfaced when one person (usually a founder or deep-pocketed donor) was carrying too much, triggering deliberate redistribution of roles.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age of AI and automated intelligence, contribution accounting transforms. Three shifts arrive:

**First: Attribution becomes algorithmically mediatable.** AI can now extract contribution signals from digital traces — code commits, meeting transcripts, message analysis, design iterations — without human manual logging. A tech product can know, nearly automatically, who wrote what, who reviewed what, who influenced whom. This could liberate contribution accounting from tedium.

But it also creates risk: **algorithmic erasure.** If an AI system is trained on visible work only (commits, presentations, documented decisions), it will systematically underweight invisible work (mentorship, emotional labor, relationship-maintenance). The registry becomes *more* biased, not less, because it's hidden inside a black box. Practitioners must actively audit AI-generated contribution maps, asking: *What did the algorithm miss?*

**Second: Contribution types multiply.** In a commons stewarded with AI assistance, new contribution types emerge: *prompt-engineering, data-preparation, model-tuning, AI-risk-management, human-oversight-of-automation.* These aren't traditional work categories. A contribution registry designed for humans breaks. You must expand your vocabulary of value to include: *Who ensured the AI system stayed aligned? Who caught its errors? Who translated its outputs for human use?* This creates opportunity for new members to enter the commons through AI-adjacent roles. It also creates friction: is "monitoring an AI" worth as much as "building a feature"? These are values conversations, now amplified.

**Third: Transparency becomes both deeper and more fragile.** A digital contribution registry can be granular to minutes, decisions, and iterations. This is powerful for accountability. It's also paralyzing if every action is recorded and visible. Practitioners must design *what gets logged and what stays private* — another layer of governance. And since AI systems can correlate data in unexpected ways, a registry that seemed neutral might reveal patterns (e.g., "woman members take more meeting time on relational work") that were hidden before. Accountability cuts both ways.

For tech product communities, contribution accounting matters more, not less. Open-source projects are now competing for maintainers with corporate jobs and AI-assistant pressure. A transparent, AI-assisted contribution registry that names relational work — community management, documentation, user support — becomes a retention tool. Projects that use it will attract diverse talent; projects that collapse it into "commits only" will become narrow and brittle.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

1. **Members can articulate the registry.** When you ask a random member, "How is contribution weighted here?" and they can point to the document and explain the logic, the system is alive. If they shrug or give conflicting answers, it's hollow.

2. **The registry shifts.** Every quarter or two, you see weights adjusted, new contribution types added, or members re-categorized. This means the system is still in conversation with reality. A registry that never changes is a fossil.

3. **Invisible workers become visible *and stay visible.* If you started by discovering relational work was unrecorded, and now it's consistently tracked, that's life. If it slides back into invisibility within six months, the pattern has decayed.

4. **Newcomers use it to find their place.** When a new member asks "How do I contribute?" and the registry helps them see a pathway (not just "volunteer hours" but "mediation," "skill-teaching," "network-building"), they integrate faster and stay longer.

**Signs of decay:**

1. **The registry becomes a burden.** If members dread updating it, if you nag people to log their hours, if it feels like surveillance, the pattern has collapsed. Contribution accounting should feel like tending a garden, not filling out a tax form.

2. **Debates harden around categories.** If arguments emerge about whether something "counts" as a contribution, and those arguments don't get resolved through re-deliberation, you're stuck. The registry has become rigid, not living.

3. **Contribution invisible again.** If, after establishing the registry, certain work (usually relational work done by minorities or undervalued demographics) slides back into invisibility, the accounting is failing. This happens quietly — check every six months.

4. **Ownership concentrates anyway.** If the registry shows contributions are distributed, but actual decision-making power concentrates in an old guard, the pattern is decorative. The registry is not connected to actual governance.

**When to replant:**

If decay has set in — if the registry feels bureaucratic and the commons has stalled — pause the accounting system and go back to deliberation. Spend a morning asking: *What does the system actually need right now?* Weights might shift. Contribution types might be reimagined. You might move from quarterly audits
