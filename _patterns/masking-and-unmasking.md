Recognize the energy cost of camouflaging neurodivergent traits and create safe contexts for authentic expression.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Autistic Self-Advocacy.

### Section 1: Context

Neurodivergent participants in collaborative value-creation systems—whether corporate teams, civic institutions, activist collectives, or tech organisations—often operate under invisible pressure to perform neurotypical behaviour. The commons they inhabit is fragmenting: on one side sits the demand for "fitting in"; on the other, the biological reality of unsustainable energy depletion. The system appears functional at surface level—meetings happen, deadlines pass, tasks complete—yet core participants are burning vital reserves that could fuel creative contribution, relational depth, and adaptive problem-solving.

This is not a productivity problem dressed as inclusion. It is a *vitality* problem. When neurodivergent people mask—suppressing stimming, rehearsing eye contact, filtering speech, managing sensory load through pure willpower—they sacrifice regenerative capacity. The organisation gains compliance; it loses resilience. The pattern emerges across all four context translations: corporate cultures that demand "professional presence," government systems that equate access with uniform participation, activist spaces that unconsciously enforce neurotypical communication norms, and tech environments where intensity and always-on availability become cultural virtues. The commons is healthy only when all participants can function without exhaustion-by-masking.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Masking vs. Unmasking.**

**Masking** offers immediate belonging: the neurodivergent participant suppresses difference, adopts dominant communication style, manages sensory needs invisibly. The group feels cohesion. Leadership sees "engagement." The cost is paid in private—exhaustion, shutdown, burnout, withdrawal from contribution when reserves empty.

**Unmasking** offers vitality: authentic presence, sustainable energy, genuine voice. It requires the commons itself to shift—to accommodate difference, to recognize stimming as information processing rather than distraction, to value asynchronous input alongside real-time performance. The cost is paid collectively at first: discomfort with unfamiliar behaviour, questions about "professionalism," genuine effort to redesign processes.

The tension is not an individual choice problem. It is a *systems design* problem. When the commons is built on unconscious neurotypical defaults—pace, sensory environment, communication rhythm, relationship-building style—masking becomes the rational adaptation. Unmasking requires not individual courage but structural permission. Without it, neurodivergent participants oscillate: they unmask when safe (often in small groups or online), remask when threatened, and eventually deplete because the toggle itself consumes energy.

The system breaks when it loses the cognitive contributions only unmasked neurodivergent people can offer—pattern recognition, hyperfocus, divergent problem-solving, sensory acuity. It also breaks when masked participants disengage, burn out, or silently leave, taking their knowledge and perspective with them.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, map the energy architecture of masking in your system, name the unwritten neurotypical defaults explicitly, and redesign core processes to permit authentic expression without cost.**

This pattern shifts the commons from an invisible-adaptation system to a *visible-accommodation* system. Instead of assuming neurodivergent participants will manage difference privately, the practitioner makes masking itself visible and then systematically reduces the need for it.

The mechanism works through three interlocking moves:

**Recognition**: The system develops literacy about masking—what it looks like, what it costs, why it happens. This is not therapy; it is diagnosis. Practitioners learn that stimming, scripting, movement breaks, and asynchronous processing are not disorders to hide but adaptive strategies with real neurological basis. This recognition roots in Autistic Self-Advocacy language, which names masking as a survival response, not a character flaw.

**Redesign**: Once masking is visible, the commons begins pruning unconscious neurotypical defaults. Meeting rhythm becomes flexible. Sensory environments accommodate difference. Communication channels multiply—not all exchange happens in real-time, high-stimulation spaces. Participation modes expand: speaking aloud is one way to contribute; writing, async input, small-group discussion, and preparation time are others. These are not special accommodations; they are structural changes that benefit everyone (remote workers, caregivers, introverts, people with chronic illness all gain oxygen).

**Normalization**: The group develops new defaults where difference is expected, not exceptional. Stimming is visible. Sensory needs are stated without shame. People unmask incrementally as safety grows. The energy previously spent on surveillance and adaptation cycles back into work, relationship, creativity. Vitality returns because the system is no longer extracting a hidden tax.

This works because it treats the commons as a living system whose health depends on all participants functioning sustainably. Masking is metabolic waste—energy spent on camouflage is energy unavailable for growth, collaboration, or contribution.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**Corporate context (Inclusive Authenticity Culture)**: Audit your meeting architecture. Measure: How many decisions happen synchronously in real-time, high-stimulation spaces? Redesign the critical path to include async input windows. In planning meetings, require a 48-hour written thinking phase before synchronous discussion. For large meetings, offer a "listening room"—a separate space where attendees can participate by video without camera-on pressure. Train managers to recognise stimming and movement as focus, not distraction; explicitly permit fidget tools, standing, and stepping out. Name one "masking-cost conversation" in your team: ask directly: "When do you feel you're performing neurotypical behaviour, and what would make that unnecessary?" Document the answers. These become your redesign priorities.

**Government context (Anti-Discrimination Policy)**: Embed neurodiversity accommodation into procurement language, not as optional add-ons but as baseline requirements. Require agencies to publish their sensory/communication architecture: meeting formats, decision timelines, communication channels, accessibility features. For policy consultation processes, mandate multiple participation modes—not just public hearings, but written submission windows, small-group conversations, asynchronous online forums. Train civil servants to recognise when policies assume neurotypical sensory load or pace. For example: a voting system that requires queueing in high-sensory environments is a design that masks neurodivergent people out. Redesign it. Establish a "neurodiversity audit" as a standing requirement in institutional review—just as you would audit financial or environmental impact.

**Activist context (Neurodiversity Acceptance)**: Make unmasking a collective practice, not a confession. In your affinity group, working group, or campaign team, establish rotating "sensory check-ins"—brief moments where people name what they need in the moment (quiet, movement, visual focus, asynchronous input, sensory break). This normalises the practice. Design direct action and event participation with multiple roles: some people are in the high-stimulus frontline; others manage information networks, write reflections, or provide logistical presence. All are essential. In meeting facilitation, actively interrupt neurotypical defaults: call out when a discussion is moving too fast for processing; offer written agendas a week ahead; permit scripted contributions. Name ableism explicitly when you see it in fellow activists, and do so as comrades, not scolds—"that pace excludes people who need processing time; let's slow and write." Build this into your culture from the start; it gets harder to unbuild later.

**Tech context (Masking Awareness AI)**: If you are building systems that involve human interaction, participation, or evaluation, audit them for neurotypical bias. Does your UI assume real-time interaction? Does your analytics treat silence as absence? Does your matching algorithm penalise async communication? Develop "masking-cost" metrics: measure not just engagement but *sustainable* engagement—do users return? Do they contribute more deeply over time? Are they cycling through periods of intense activity followed by burnout-withdrawal? These patterns signal that your system is extracting masking cost. Build design features that reduce it: asynchronous-first interfaces, visible stim-friendly affordances, communication defaults that don't assume neurotypical social preference. If you are working on AI that evaluates human performance, behaviour, or suitability, test it explicitly for neurodiversity bias. Does it penalise stimming, echolalia, scripted speech, or information-dense communication? If yes, it is automating discrimination.

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

Unmasking creates space for the specific cognitive gifts neurodivergent people carry: pattern recognition becomes visible, hyperfocus becomes an asset for complex problems, alternative communication styles enrich dialogue. Teams that reduce masking-cost gain access to these capacities. Relationally, trust deepens when people stop performing and start being present. Retention improves—when neurodivergent participants are no longer exhausted by constant adaptation, they stay, contribute over years, build expertise. The commons also becomes more livable for everyone: the accommodation that permits neurodivergent unmasking (flexibility, async channels, sensory awareness) benefits remote workers, people with chronic illness, caregivers, introverts. The system becomes genuinely inclusive, not performatively so.

**What risks emerge:**

The commons assessment scores signal real vulnerabilities. **Resilience (3.0)** is particularly thin: this pattern sustains existing vitality without generating new adaptive capacity. If unmasking becomes routinised—if it hardens into new defaults that exclude other kinds of difference—the system can become rigid. Watch for: accommodation fatigue (the group tires of accommodation and slowly pressures back toward neurotypical norms), performative unmasking (people adopt the language of authenticity but still mask), or accommodation that serves some neurodivergent people while excluding others (ADHD needs different accommodation than autism or anxiety). **Stakeholder architecture, ownership, and autonomy all sit at 3.0**, suggesting that this pattern alone does not distribute power or decision-making. Unmasking without genuine co-design of the commons can feel like benevolent accommodation from above, not co-stewardship. The deeper risk: if the culture does not shift—if unmasking is permitted but silently stigmatised—masked participants will burnout into silence or exit.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**The Autistic Self-Advocacy Network (ASAN):** ASAN's foundational practice is making masking visible and refusing it structurally. Their meetings routinely accommodate stimming, scripting, and asynchronous input. Members bring fidget tools without comment. Conversations move at a pace that permits processing. Notably, ASAN does not treat unmasking as individual healing—it treats it as a commons design requirement. When a neurodivergent person stops masking within ASAN, they often describe not relief but recognition: "I realised how much energy I had been spending." The pattern's power lies in the shift from private coping to collective redesign.

**Mozilla's "Neurodiversity Hiring" initiative:** Mozilla began auditing their hiring process for neurotypical bias—timed interviews, phone calls, small-talk sections, rapid-fire questioning. These formats favour neurotypical communication style and penalise people who need processing time, written preparation, or alternative pacing. They redesigned: candidates could now request written questions in advance, async video responses, or structured interviews with clear frameworks. They found that neurodivergent candidates they previously missed were exceptional at attention to detail, edge-case thinking, and long-focus work. The unmasking happened at hire, not after. Teams that included neurodivergent engineers (openly, not hidden) reported more rigorous problem-solving and fewer missed edge cases.

**The Democratic Socialists of America's disability justice working group:** This activist collective made unmasking a collective practice through "access meetings"—short, structured conversations at the start of campaign gatherings where people named sensory, communication, and participation needs. Over time, this normalised the practice: needing a quiet room or asking for a written agenda became unremarkable. Importantly, they did not wait for perfect accommodation before starting work; they designed action with multiple participation modes built in. Scouting was both frontline-visible and information-management work. This kept neurodivergent activists in the work, contributing over years rather than burning out in months.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

The emergence of AI introduces new dimensions to masking and unmasking. On one side, AI systems can become powerful tools for reducing masking-cost: real-time communication tools with caption support, scheduling systems that respect async-first workflows, or presentation software that permits multiple input modalities. On the other, AI introduces new masking pressures. Algorithmic evaluation of performance, tone, or engagement can invisibly penalise neurodivergent communication. If your system uses AI to assess "engagement" or "cultural fit," it is likely automating neurotypical bias at scale. A hiring algorithm trained on historical data will reproduce the advantage given to candidates who mask well in interviews.

The "Masking Awareness AI" context translation suggests a new literacy: practitioners need to audit AI systems for hidden neurotypical defaults. Does your recommendation engine assume linear, continuous engagement, or does it account for sustainable patterns (engagement, focus, restoration)? Does your performance evaluation penalise async contributors? Does your chatbot assume neurotypical social preference?

More subtly: as people spend more time in AI-mediated environments, the pressure to mask can shift. Some neurodivergent people report that text-based, asynchronous AI interaction is less exhausting than synchronous human conversation because it permits processing time. Others report that AI interaction enables unmasking—you can script, repeat, request clarification without social penalty. This is not a reason to replace human commons with AI; it is a signal that AI-mediated spaces can teach us what unmasking infrastructure looks like. The leverage: study how neurodivergent people interact with AI systems, and use that knowledge to redesign human systems.

The risk: as work becomes more AI-mediated, the pressure to perform for algorithms can become a new form of masking. Practitioners must name it explicitly and refuse it at the systems level, not the individual level.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

Observable indicators that this pattern is working:

1. **Visible stimming without comment.** People stim openly in meetings—fidgeting, pacing, hand-flapping, rocking—and it is not framed as a problem. Other participants maintain focus and do not signal discomfort. This signals that the group has genuinely redesigned its defaults, not merely tolerated difference.

2. **Async contributions as standard, not exception.** Written input is not a workaround for people who can't attend; it is a core channel. Decisions wait for async input. Meetings explicitly honour it. This reduces the pressure to perform real-time engagement.

3. **People describe reduced exhaustion and increased capacity.** Not just neurodivergent participants but the whole team reports lower meeting fatigue, better thinking, and more sustained focus. This signals that the accommodation is genuinely reducing system-wide masking-cost.

4. **Explicit naming of masking in retrospectives.** When teams reflect on what worked or didn't, neurodivergent members can say, "I was masking in that conversation because X," and this becomes data for redesign, not confession or weakness.

**Signs of decay:**

Observable indicators that the pattern is failing or becoming hollow:

1. **Unmasking is praised but not structurally supported.** The culture celebrates authenticity ("we love neurodiversity here") while meetings remain real-time, sensory-heavy, and pace-driven. Unmasking becomes an individual performance ("look how brave they are") rather than a systems shift.

2. **Masking pressure cycles.** Under deadline pressure or crisis, the commons reverts to neurotypical speed and intensity. Accommodation is sacrificed for "urgency." Neurodivergent participants remask and burnout follows. This signals that unmasking was never embedded; it was optional.

3. **Participation narrows.** Over time, neurodivergent members contribute less, attend fewer meetings, or leave. The culture stops asking why. This is the silent failure mode—the pattern looked alive until the core participants burned out.

4. **Accommodation becomes tokenized.** One person is offered a quiet room; the meeting structure itself doesn't change. Sensory load increases; access becomes individual coping, not collective design. The commons is back to extracting private adaptation.

**When to replant:**

If you see decay signs, redesign begins with honesty: ask neurodivergent participants directly what is no longer working and what would restore vitality. Do not assume the pattern failed; assume the system reverted. Replant by choosing one core process—hiring, meetings, decision-making—and redesigning it from neurodiversity-first principles. This is not starting over; it is reinforcing the root when the plant has drained the soil.

The right moment to redesign is when you first notice unmasking becoming optional again, not when burnout has already begun. Early intervention is the difference between adjustment and rescue.
