# FF020: KISS (Keep It Simple Security)

### 1. Overview

The "Keep It Simple Security" (KISS) is a set of standardized, open-source legal documents designed to simplify the process of early-stage fundraising for startups. Developed by the venture fund and seed accelerator 500 Startups, the KISS was created to provide a more balanced and founder-friendly alternative to other convertible financing instruments, such as convertible notes and SAFEs (Simple Agreements for Future Equity). The core purpose of the KISS is to reduce the time, complexity, and legal costs associated with seed-stage investments, allowing founders to focus on building their businesses rather than getting bogged down in lengthy negotiations. By offering a clear and transparent framework for investment, the KISS aims to streamline the fundraising process for both entrepreneurs and investors, fostering a more efficient and equitable startup ecosystem.

The problem that the KISS addresses is the often-onerous nature of early-stage fundraising. Traditionally, startups seeking seed capital have had to navigate a complex landscape of legal and financial instruments, each with its own set of terms, conditions, and potential pitfalls. This complexity can be particularly challenging for first-time founders, who may lack the experience and resources to negotiate favorable terms. The KISS seeks to level the playing field by providing a standardized set of documents that are easy to understand and implement. This not only saves time and money but also helps to build trust and alignment between founders and investors from the very beginning of their relationship.

The KISS is deeply rooted in the principles of commons-aligned value creation. By providing open-source legal documents, 500 Startups has created a shared resource that can be used by the entire startup community. This commitment to open-source principles promotes transparency, collaboration, and knowledge sharing, all of which are essential for building a healthy and sustainable startup ecosystem. Furthermore, the KISS's emphasis on simplicity and fairness helps to create a more equitable distribution of value, ensuring that both founders and investors are treated fairly. In this way, the KISS can be seen as a tool for building a more inclusive and democratic form of capitalism, one that is based on shared values and mutual respect.

### 2. Core Principles

1.  **Simplicity and Clarity:** The KISS documents are designed to be as simple and straightforward as possible, avoiding complex legal jargon and convoluted terms. This makes them accessible to both experienced and inexperienced founders and investors.
2.  **Founder-Friendliness:** The KISS was created with the needs of founders in mind, offering more balanced terms than many other convertible financing instruments. This includes provisions such as the ability to convert at a discount to the price of the next financing round and the inclusion of a valuation cap.
3.  **Investor Protection:** While founder-friendly, the KISS also includes provisions to protect the interests of investors. These include information rights, which give investors access to key company metrics, and major transaction rights, which give them a say in major corporate decisions.
4.  **Standardization:** The KISS provides a standardized set of documents that can be used by any startup, regardless of its industry or location. This standardization helps to reduce legal costs and streamline the fundraising process.
5.  **Open Source:** The KISS documents are open source, meaning that they are freely available to anyone who wants to use them. This commitment to open-source principles promotes transparency and collaboration within the startup community.
6.  **Efficiency:** By simplifying and standardizing the fundraising process, the KISS helps to make it more efficient. This allows founders to spend less time on fundraising and more time on building their businesses.

### 3. Key Practices

1.  **Choose the Right KISS:** There are two main types of KISS documents: the debt version and the equity version. The debt version is a convertible note that accrues interest, while the equity version is a convertible security that does not. Founders should carefully consider which version is right for their specific circumstances.
2.  **Negotiate the Key Terms:** While the KISS documents are standardized, there are still a few key terms that need to be negotiated between the founder and the investor. These include the amount of the investment, the valuation cap, and the discount rate.
3.  **Use the KISS for Seed-Stage Fundraising:** The KISS is designed for seed-stage fundraising and may not be appropriate for later-stage rounds. As a company matures, it will likely need to use more complex financing instruments.
4.  **Consult with a Lawyer:** While the KISS is designed to be simple, it is still a legal document. Founders should always consult with a lawyer before signing a KISS to ensure that they understand all of the terms and conditions.
5.  **Be Transparent with Investors:** The KISS is designed to promote transparency and trust between founders and investors. Founders should be open and honest with their investors about all aspects of their business, including their financials, their progress, and their challenges.
6.  **Leverage the 500 Startups Network:** The KISS was created by 500 Startups, one of the most active seed-stage investors in the world. By using the KISS, founders can tap into the 500 Startups network of mentors, advisors, and other resources.
7.  **Contribute to the Commons:** The KISS is an open-source project, and founders are encouraged to contribute to its development. This can include providing feedback on the documents, suggesting improvements, and sharing their experiences with other founders.

### 4. Implementation

Implementing the KISS (Keep It Simple Security) in a startup's fundraising strategy involves a straightforward process, designed to be efficient and transparent. The first step is for the startup's founders to determine whether the KISS is the right financing instrument for their current needs. This decision should be based on the company's stage, the amount of capital being raised, and the long-term goals of the business. Once the decision is made to use a KISS, the founders must choose between the debt and equity versions of the document. The debt version functions as a convertible note, accruing interest over time, while the equity version is a simpler security that converts to equity at a later date without the interest component. This choice depends on the preferences of both the founders and the potential investors.

After selecting the appropriate KISS version, the next step is to negotiate the key terms with the investors. The primary terms to be agreed upon are the valuation cap, which sets a maximum valuation at which the investment will convert into equity, and the discount rate, which offers the investor a percentage discount on the price of shares in the subsequent financing round. Once these terms are finalized, the KISS document can be prepared and signed by both parties. Given the standardized nature of the KISS, this process is typically much faster and less expensive than negotiating a traditional priced equity round. However, it is still highly recommended that both the startup and the investor consult with legal counsel to ensure that all parties fully understand the terms and implications of the agreement. The final step is the transfer of funds, after which the startup can focus on utilizing the capital to grow the business, with the KISS agreement governing the future conversion of the investment into equity.

### 5. 7 Pillars Assessment

| Pillar | Score (1-5) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | 4 | The KISS documents have a clear and focused purpose: to simplify and standardize early-stage fundraising. This directly addresses a significant pain point for startups and contributes to a more efficient and accessible ecosystem. |
| Governance | 4 | While created and maintained by 500 Startups, the open-source nature of the KISS documents allows for a degree of community governance. The widespread adoption and standardization of these documents also create a de facto governance structure for early-stage financing. |
| Culture | 4 | The KISS promotes a culture of transparency, simplicity, and fairness. By providing a clear and balanced legal framework, it encourages a more collaborative and less adversarial relationship between founders and investors. |
| Incentives | 4 | The incentives are designed to be fair and balanced for both founders and investors. The inclusion of a valuation cap and discount rate provides upside for investors, while the overall simplicity and founder-friendly terms benefit the startup. |
| Knowledge | 5 | The KISS is a prime example of knowledge sharing within the startup community. By open-sourcing these legal documents, 500 Startups has created a valuable public good that empowers founders and investors with the knowledge and tools they need to navigate the complexities of fundraising. |
| Technology | 4 | While not a technology in the traditional sense, the KISS leverages the principles of open-source technology to create a scalable and replicable legal framework. It is a tool that can be easily distributed and adapted, much like open-source software. |
| Resilience | 4 | The standardization and simplicity of the KISS make the fundraising process more resilient. By reducing ambiguity and legal complexity, it minimizes the risk of disputes and misunderstandings, contributing to more stable and long-term relationships between startups and their investors. |
| **Overall** | **4.0** | **The KISS pattern strongly aligns with the principles of commons-aligned value creation by providing a simple, fair, and open-source tool for early-stage fundraising. It promotes a culture of transparency and collaboration, and its widespread adoption has made it a valuable public good for the startup community.** |

### 6. When to Use

-   **Early-Stage Seed Rounds:** The KISS is ideal for a startup's first significant fundraising round, typically after initial bootstrapping or friends and family funding.
-   **Bridge Rounds:** It can be used for smaller bridge rounds between larger financing rounds to provide a quick injection of capital.
-   **Accelerator Programs:** Many accelerator programs use the KISS or similar instruments for their initial investments in participating startups.
-   **First-Time Founders:** The simplicity of the KISS makes it particularly well-suited for first-time founders who may not have experience with complex legal negotiations.
-   **When Speed is a Priority:** When a startup needs to close a funding round quickly, the KISS can be a much faster alternative to a traditional priced equity round.
-   **To Minimize Legal Costs:** The standardized nature of the KISS can significantly reduce the legal fees associated with a fundraising round.

### 7. Anti-Patterns and Gotchas

-   **Using it for Later-Stage Rounds:** The KISS is not designed for later-stage financing rounds, which typically require more complex legal structures and investor rights.
-   **Not Understanding the Terms:** While simple, the KISS is still a legal document. Founders should not sign it without fully understanding all of its terms and implications.
-   **Failing to Negotiate Key Terms:** The valuation cap and discount rate are negotiable and should be carefully considered to ensure a fair deal for both the startup and the investor.
-   **Ignoring the Pro Rata Rights:** The KISS often includes pro rata rights, which give investors the right to maintain their ownership percentage in future financing rounds. Founders should be aware of how this can impact their cap table over time.
-   **Misunderstanding the Conversion Mechanics:** The conversion of the KISS into equity can be complex, especially in different scenarios such as a sale of the company or a subsequent financing round. Founders should model out different scenarios to understand the potential impact on their ownership.
-   **Relying on it as a Substitute for a Strong Business:** The KISS is a financing tool, not a substitute for a solid business plan and a strong team. Founders should focus on building a great company, not just on raising money.
