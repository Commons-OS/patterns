When stated identity diverges from lived values, people experience cognitive dissonance. Commons support integrity by creating accountability structures that align identity claims with behavior.

[!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Values alignment.

### Section 1: Context

Intrapreneurs operate in a permeable space between corporate structure and emergent possibility—they are stewarding something new while embedded in existing systems. In this environment, identity claims accumulate quickly: we say we are "customer-centric," "innovative," "values-driven," "transparent." These claims become the operating mythology of the venture. Yet lived behavior often tells a different story. Decisions are made in closed rooms. Customer feedback is heard but not acted on. Short-term metrics override stated mission. The system fragments not because the mission was wrong, but because the gap between what we claim to be and what we actually do becomes visible to everyone who works inside it. This pattern addresses that specific rupture—the moment when an intrapreneur, team, or emerging organization realizes that their identity claims have become hollow. The tension is not abstract; it erodes trust, triggers quiet exits, and creates what researchers call "identity work"—the exhausting labor of maintaining a false coherence. Commons that address this directly tend to be more vital, more attracting of committed co-stewards, and more resilient under stress.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Espoused vs. Enacted.**

An intrapreneur announces: "We prioritize psychological safety." Yet the person who raised a critical question in the last meeting was not invited to the next planning session. A product team says: "We serve underserved communities." Yet the roadmap is shaped entirely by paying customers who look nothing like those communities. A movement claims: "We are radically decentralized." Yet decisions still flow through a core circle that no one formally named. 

The enacted values are often not malicious—they reflect real constraints (budget, time, risk tolerance, skill gaps). But the dissonance between espoused and enacted creates a psychological and relational tax. People begin to doubt the system's integrity. They trust the system less, contribute less discretionary energy, and begin hedging their own commitment. For intrapreneurs, this is catastrophic: you are trying to birth something new in the margins of an existing system. Your only durable fuel is conviction and voluntary participation. Once people sense that your stated identity is decorative—that you say one thing and do another—the commons begins to hollow out. The problem is not the gap itself; many worthwhile endeavors have gaps between aspiration and capability. The problem is the *unacknowledged* gap, the pretense that no gap exists when everyone can see it.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, create regular, structured accountability practices where identity claims are tested against enacted decisions, and visible adjustments are made.**

This pattern works by making the gap visible and workable. Instead of pretending alignment, you surface it, name it, and treat it as design feedback—not failure.

The mechanism is rooted in what values alignment traditions call "integrity work": the deliberate cultivation of coherence between what you claim and what you do. In living systems terms, this is how a commons maintains its own root system. A tree does not command its roots to grow toward water; it creates conditions where roots can sense and grow. Similarly, this pattern creates conditions where people can sense misalignment and adjust course before the divergence becomes structural.

The practice works in three interlocking moves:

**First: Externalize the identity claim.** Rather than letting stated values float as aspirational decoration, write them down. Be specific: "We gather customer feedback weekly" is testable. "We listen to customers" is not. This act of writing creates a boundary between aspiration and pretense.

**Second: Create a rhythm of reflection on enacted behavior.** Monthly or quarterly, gather the core stewards and ask: "Where did we actually live our stated values this period? Where did we diverge? What did we learn?" This is not a performance review; it is a diagnostic. You are asking: "What is the system actually teaching us about who we are?"

**Third: Make visible adjustments.** When misalignment appears, the commons has three choices: adjust the identity claim to match current capacity ("We aspire to weekly feedback; we are doing monthly, and that is working"), adjust the behavior ("We said weekly, we must resource it"), or acknowledge a genuine trade-off ("Customer feedback slowed our sprint; we chose speed; here is what we learned"). The key is that the adjustment is named publicly, not hidden.

This pattern sustains vitality because it prevents the slow toxicity of pretense. It also creates feedback loops: a commons that regularly audits its own alignment learns faster, attracts people who value integrity over comfort, and builds reputation for trustworthiness even when capacity is limited.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**Corporate context:** Establish a monthly "Values Audit" meeting where the leadership team or steering group reviews one stated identity claim against hiring decisions, budget allocations, and calendar time over the past month. Pick a different claim each month. For example: "We empower frontline decision-making" — then review: Did we reverse a decision made by a junior person? Did we create space for them to decide without approval loops? Were we visibly frustrated when they chose differently? Name what you see. Write it down. Decide: Is this claim accurate? If not, revise the claim or commit to specific behavior changes. This is not performed for external stakeholders; it is for internal coherence. The act of doing it monthly inoculates the organization against the creeping pretense that kills intrapreneurship.

**Government context:** Apply the same audit to public service identity claims: "We serve all constituents equally," "We are transparent," "We respond to community input." A public health team states they are "equity-focused." Audit: Which communities are we actually reaching? Which ones are we not reaching despite saying we serve them all? Why? Make this visible to staff. Government institutions suffer uniquely from the espoused-enacted gap because they must claim to serve everyone; rigorous auditing creates permission to acknowledge real constraints and actual priorities, which ironically builds more trust than sustained pretense.

**Activist context:** Movement integrity is the primary currency. Implement a "Values Reckoning" practice quarterly where the core circle reviews: Do we actually practice the horizontal decision-making we preach? Who has informal veto power? Who is burned out because their labor is invisible? Where are we reproducing the hierarchies we are trying to dismantle? Name it explicitly in the group. Adjust either the claim or the practice. Movements that skip this work often collapse when leadership realizes the hierarchy they created mirrors the one they opposed. Early and regular auditing prevents that decay.

**Tech context:** For product teams building for users, create a "User Value Audit" sprint where the team reviews product decisions against stated user values. The product claims to be "accessible to elderly users." Audit: Did we actually test with elderly users? Did we ship features they requested? Did we deprioritize accessibility when deadline pressure came? Document the gap. Either retrofit the product, revise the claim, or make a deliberate trade-off decision (speed over accessibility this quarter, with a commitment to rebalance next quarter). This prevents the common failure mode where products accumulate aspirational claims that become brittle.

All contexts require: (1) a regular rhythm, (2) specific claims being tested, (3) honest naming of gaps without blame, (4) visible adjustment. The adjustment is the critical move—if you audit and then ignore the findings, the practice becomes cynical theater and erodes trust more than no audit would.

---

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

This pattern generates **active trust**—not the blind kind, but the kind built on predictable integrity. When people see their commons regularly testing itself against its own claims and actually adjusting, they contribute more discretionary energy. Recruitment becomes easier because reputation for integrity is rare and attractive. The commons also develops **faster learning loops**: by regularly comparing espoused values to enacted behavior, you surface systemic problems earlier. A product team that audits user alignment quarterly catches capability gaps before they calcify into product failures. Intrapreneurs report that this practice reduces the psychological tax of identity work—you are no longer expending energy maintaining a false coherence. There is also a **forgiveness effect**: when misalignment is acknowledged and addressed openly, people are more willing to excuse temporary gaps. "We said weekly feedback and we slipped to monthly because we lost a team member" is forgivable. Hidden gaps breed resentment.

**What risks emerge:**

The primary risk is **routinization into hollow ritual**. You can audit values monthly and learn nothing if the practice becomes performative—boxes checked, no real adjustment. Watch for this: If the same misalignments appear three quarters in a row and nothing substantive shifts, the practice has become theater. The assessment score for **resilience (3.0)** reflects a real limitation: this pattern sustains existing health but does not generate adaptive capacity in the way that more emergent practices do. A commons that relies heavily on values auditing can become rigid, focused on maintaining alignment with a static identity claim rather than evolving identity as conditions change. **Autonomy (3.0)** also flags a risk: frequent public auditing of values can create social pressure to conform to the stated identity, reducing the freedom people have to operate authentically. If the audit becomes a tool for enforcing conformity rather than surfacing reality, it stifles the very autonomy that commons need. Finally, there is a **vulnerability to bad faith**: a leadership team can use audits to appear transparent while subtly managing what gets named. Protect against this by rotating who facilitates the audit and by including voices from outside the core circle.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**1. Mozilla Foundation (2018–2020):** Mozilla published explicit values around openness, innovation, and community-driven development. As growth pressured decision-making, engineers began to notice a gap: decisions were being made in leadership meetings without the transparency the organization claimed. Mozilla initiated a monthly "Values Alignment" review where engineering leads could surface specific instances of misalignment. The practice surfaced real trade-offs: rapid scaling required some decision-making to be more centralized than the stated values suggested. Rather than hiding this, Mozilla made it explicit: "We value transparency. We also value speed. Here is where we chose speed. Here is what we lost. Here is when we will revisit this." This honest framing prevented the slow trust erosion that kills distributed organizations and allowed contributors to make informed decisions about their engagement.

**2. Color of Change (activist context):** This racial justice organization practices what they call "Internal Alignment Audits," examining whether their decision-making, staff composition, and resource allocation match their stated commitment to centering Black leadership. When they discovered their primary decision-making body was not demographically representative of their community, they did not hide it or excuse it. They made it visible, examined the structural reasons, and deliberately reshaped governance. The practice keeps the organization honest about living its values rather than merely performing them. This is especially important for activist organizations because members often sacrifice income and stability; they do so based on trust in the organization's integrity. Regular audits protect that trust.

**3. Basecamp (tech/corporate context):** The company explicitly values "small team, controlled growth, and employee wellbeing." When they faced a moment of public controversy around communication and values in 2021, they used values audits to examine where their stated commitments had drifted. They reviewed: How much were we actually checking in on wellbeing? Were decisions about growth really controlled, or were we drifting toward scale without intention? The audit surfaced real gaps and led to visible changes (restructuring, communication changes, explicit trade-off decisions). While the reorganization was contentious, the willingness to audit publicly maintained credibility with supporters who valued the company's integrity over perfection.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age where AI is generating outputs at scale—content, code, decisions, recommendations—the espoused-enacted gap takes on new urgency. A product team can claim "human-centered design" while an AI system is making the actual design decisions with no human in the loop. A company can say "we value privacy" while deploying machine learning models trained on user data without explicit consent. The problem compounds because AI decisions are often opaque; the enacted values are hidden not just from stakeholders but from the teams operating the system.

**This pattern becomes more critical, not less.** Here is why: AI accelerates the pace at which identity claims can diverge from actual behavior. A human-written decision takes time and leaves traces; an algorithmic decision at scale happens in milliseconds across thousands of users. The gap can metastasize before anyone notices. Regular audits of "stated values" versus "what the system actually does" become a form of AI governance. A tech team claiming fairness must audit: Is the algorithm actually fair across demographic groups? Is the training data representative? Are edge cases being caught? The audit must be frequent and specific because AI systems can drift in their behavior without any code change—simply by operating on new data.

AI also creates new leverage: you can now instrument values audits with technical tools. Deploy automated tests that check whether a system's output aligns with stated values. Use model transparency tools to surface where decisions are being made. Use audit logs to track whether stated policies are actually being enforced. But this leverage comes with a risk: you can create an illusion of alignment by measuring the wrong things. An algorithm can pass fairness tests and still be unfair in ways the tests do not capture. The pattern still requires human judgment and regular reflection, not just technical auditing.

The cognitive era also surfaces a deeper question: As AI systems increasingly author organizational decisions, who is responsible for alignment? If an AI recommends a hiring decision that conflicts with stated values, is that a failure of the AI system, the team that deployed it, or the stated values themselves? Regular values audits create space to answer that question together rather than discovering the misalignment after harm is done.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

(1) People name misalignments directly in meetings without defensiveness. When someone says, "That decision didn't match what we said we value," others nod rather than deflect. (2) Adjustments are actually made: identity claims get revised, or behavior shifts. You can point to instances where the audit led to a visible change. (3) Trust in the organization remains stable even when capacity limitations are revealed. People believe the organization because they see it acknowledging its own gaps rather than pretending coherence. (4) New people coming into the commons pick up the rhythm of auditing without needing to be taught; it is embedded in how decisions are made.

**Signs of decay:**

(1) Audits happen on schedule but nothing changes. You notice the same misalignments year after year. (2) Audits become a space where leadership performs transparency rather than genuinely examining the gap. Questions are anticipated and managed. (3) People stop naming misalignments in the regular audit; instead, they complain about them in side conversations. The practice has become unsafe. (4) Identity claims proliferate without being tested. The commons keeps adding new values without examining whether existing ones are being lived. The list of claims becomes decorative, and no one takes any of them seriously.

**When to replant:**

This pattern should be redesigned when the commons faces significant identity shift—a merger, a change in mission, or a moment when old values no longer fit emerging reality. Rather than auditing against stale claims, step back and ask: Who are we becoming? What do we actually value now? Restart the audit with fresh claims, then establish a new rhythm. If the commons has grown significantly, consider distributing the audit practice: smaller teams audit their own values alignment, and a rotating representative brings findings to the larger whole. This prevents the audit from becoming a performance by distant leadership and roots it in the lived experience of people actually doing the work.
