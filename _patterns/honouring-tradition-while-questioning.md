### Section 1: Context

Intrapreneurship thrives in organizations, movements, public institutions, and product teams that carry inherited ways of working—processes, rituals, values, decision-making structures—often absorbed without examination. These traditions serve a purpose: they reduce friction, anchor identity, and preserve hard-won knowledge. Yet they calcify. A startup's founding ritual becomes bureaucracy. A movement's core principle becomes dogma used to reject necessary adaptation. A government agency's procedural safeguard becomes a barrier to serving constituents better. Product teams inherit architectural choices from predecessors without understanding why those choices were made, then defend them as inevitable.

The system begins fragmenting when newcomers and contexts shift. The intrapreneurs—people embedded in these systems with permission to experiment—feel the friction between "this is how we do things" and "this doesn't work anymore." They sense the gap between stated values and actual practice. They see silos that were once protective now isolating. Meanwhile, those stewarding tradition experience this questioning as threat or disrespect. The system stagnates into one of two states: either rigid orthodoxy where all questioning is shut down, or cynical erosion where nothing is believed in enough to protect.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Honouring vs. It.**

Honouring means: receiving what came before with genuine respect, understanding why it exists, recognizing the intelligence it holds, protecting what still creates real value. It's an act of gratitude toward the ancestors (literal or figurative) who solved hard problems.

Questioning means: examining whether this tradition serves present needs, identifying what has become decorative or harmful, testing whether the original conditions that justified this practice still hold, and creating space for better-adapted forms.

When honouring dominates, the system becomes a museum. Traditions persist regardless of efficacy. Intrapreneurs who surface real problems—"our onboarding process takes three months and people are leaving"—are told they lack commitment or don't understand our culture. Knowledge dies with the people who held it. The organization becomes brittle; it cannot adapt when contexts shift sharply.

When questioning dominates, the system becomes amnesiac. Every new cohort reinvents wheels. Hard-won patterns are discarded because someone found them inconvenient. Trust erodes—why invest in shared practices if they'll be dismantled by the next wave? Valuable social cohesion fractures. People feel unmoored.

The breaks are real. In corporate settings, this shows as either sclerotic process (honouring-dominant) or chaotic churn (questioning-dominant). In movements, it appears as either dogmatic purism that loses relevance or opportunistic shapeshifting that loses coherence. In government, it becomes either ossified procedure or reactive policy whiplash. In products, it manifests as either legacy technical debt that prevents innovation or constant rewrites that lose stability.

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, create structured forums where tradition-holders and questioners meet as peers to co-examine what persists, what evolves, and what is retired—with the outcome that some practices are renewed with fresh intention and some are intentionally released.**

This pattern works by shifting from binary choice to *selective evolution*. It treats traditions not as static monuments but as living practices with a lifecycle. Some practices should persist because they solve perennial problems. Some should be retired because their conditions have fundamentally changed. Some should be evolved—kept in spirit but transformed in form.

The mechanism: Create regular, designated spaces where the tension is named explicitly and held as necessary, not pathological. A council, a working group, a seasonal review—whatever vessel fits your scale. The key is that it includes people deeply rooted in tradition and people who came in questioning it. Not as opponents but as complementary organs.

In these forums, the work is not debate but *translation*. Tradition-holders articulate: Why does this practice exist? What problem does it solve? What conditions enabled it to emerge? What would break if it disappeared? Questioners ask: Do those conditions still hold? Has this problem shifted? What are we losing by keeping this form? What could we gain by changing it?

The outcome is discriminating continuity. Some traditions are renewed—deepened, their logic made explicit, sometimes adapted for new contexts but recognizably continuous. Some are released—acknowledged as having served real purposes, now retired with ceremony. Some are hybridized—the spirit retained, the form transformed.

This works because it honors the real intelligence in tradition while freeing practitioners from false loyalty to practices that no longer serve. It generates what cultural evolution scholars call *selective retention*: the system evolves by keeping what still creates value and releasing what doesn't, rather than cycling between wholesale orthodoxy and wholesale rejection.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**Create a "Living Practice Council" with dual membership: established practitioners and newer voices.**

The council meets seasonally (quarterly works well). Membership rotates so no single cohort becomes entrenched. The size should be small enough for real dialogue—six to twelve people. Include at least one person whose role is explicitly to question rather than defend.

**Name three to five core practices for examination per cycle.** These are not decisions to make but living things to understand together. A practice might be: "how we onboard," "how we make resource decisions," "how we measure success," "how we resolve conflict," "how we relate to failure."

**Structure each examination in three phases:**

*Phase 1: Origin.* The practice-holder explains: When did this start? What problem was it solving? Who needed it? What conditions made it possible? This is not defense but archaeology. You're excavating the intelligence.

*Phase 2: Presence.* Current practitioners describe: Does this still solve that problem? Has the problem shifted? What are we protecting by keeping this? What are we losing? Are there hidden costs? This generates clarity about what the practice actually does now, not what we assume it does.

*Phase 3: Evolution.* The council decides together: Keep as-is (and why that renewal matters), evolve the form (keep the spirit, change the mechanism), retire with ceremony (acknowledge the contribution, release the practice), or experiment (run a parallel version to test something new).

**For corporate contexts:** Apply this to signature processes—hiring, performance review, cross-functional collaboration, decision-making thresholds. When you examine "why do we require sign-off from five people," you often discover the original reason (preventing catastrophic mistakes in a manufacturing context) no longer applies, and you can streamline. But you also might discover a hidden value (ensuring perspectives from safety, operations, and customer teams meet early) worth keeping in evolved form.

**For government and public service:** Use this with procedural requirements and stakeholder engagement models. Many safeguards exist because past harms happened. The practice council asks: What harm were we protecting against? Does that harm still exist? Has the context changed such that this safeguard creates new problems (like inaccessibility or delay)? This prevents the trap where agencies either follow procedures that no longer protect anything or abandon procedures in ways that recreate old harms.

**For activist and movement contexts:** Apply to decision-making structures, meeting practices, and core rituals. Movements often inherit practices from predecessor moments—consensus-based decisions, particular forms of direct action, specific language or framing. The council examines: Does this practice still build the power we need? Does it still reflect our values? Has it become a loyalty test that excludes people we need? This prevents sclerosis while protecting intentionality.

**For product and tech teams:** Examine architectural decisions, release practices, and technical traditions. Engineers inherit systems—"we always code-review," "we use this particular stack," "we maintain backwards compatibility at all costs." The council asks: What risk were we mitigating? Do those risks still exist? What possibilities might open if we evolved this practice? This prevents both technical debt and reckless rewrites.

**Document the decisions and the reasoning.** Write down not just what was decided but why—the conditions that made a practice necessary, the current conditions that changed, the values it expresses. This becomes institutional memory that persists beyond the people who held it.

**Rotate the "elder" role.** Don't let tradition-holding become one person's job. Invite different experienced practitioners into the role of explaining why things are as they are. This prevents gatekeeping and distributes knowledge.

---

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

Practitioners stop experiencing tradition as either constraint or embarrassment. Instead, it becomes a toolkit they understand and can use consciously. This generates a particular kind of autonomy: not freedom from structure, but freedom through understanding structure deeply enough to know when to keep it and when to change it.

Organizational memory strengthens because the reasoning behind practices is made explicit rather than assumed. New people can learn not just "we do this" but "we do this because..." This accelerates their capacity to participate in the system competently.

Trust between generations of practitioners deepens. The questioning cohort feels heard and respected rather than dismissed as disloyal. The tradition-bearing cohort feels understood and valued rather than resented for slowing things down. This shift is visceral.

Actual adaptation becomes possible. Systems that practice this pattern can respond to changed contexts without either rigidity or recklessness. They evolve faster than fully orthodox systems and more coherently than purely reactive ones.

**What risks emerge:**

The practice can become performative—councils that meet but don't actually make difficult decisions, or make decisions that leave everything untouched. This hollows the pattern into ritual without substance. Watch for: decisions that always preserve the status quo, or that never actually change anything despite extensive discussion.

The tension can resurface with renewed intensity if the council doesn't have real authority. If questioning is invited but ignored, or if tradition-holders can veto change despite explicit reasoning to evolve, the system recreates the original binary. Resentment intensifies because people see the form without the substance.

With resilience rated at 3.0, this pattern is vulnerable to crisis. When the system faces acute pressure—market shift, political upheaval, sudden resource constraint—the patient work of structured examination can be abandoned in favor of either authoritarian decree ("we're doing this, period") or panic-driven rewrites. The commons weakens fastest under stress.

There's a risk of *false equivalence*: treating all traditions as equal, all questions as equally valid. Some traditions encode crucial safety, equity, or efficacy that doesn't appear in casual examination. The pattern requires sophisticated judgment, not just symmetrical listening.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Example 1: The Rockwood Leadership Institute's organizational evolution.** Rockwood is a nonprofit leadership development organization founded in 2000 around particular methodologies (emotional intelligence work, systems thinking, "transformative leadership" framing). By 2015, their programming had attracted more practitioners and participants from global contexts, many of whom questioned whether the original US-centric model served diversity work or reinforced it. Rather than either defending the original approach or abandoning it wholesale, Rockwood created what they called "methodology councils" that examined each core module: Who designed this? What assumptions about learning and power does it embed? How does it land in different cultural contexts? The outcome was evolution, not replacement—they kept the structure of emotional awareness work (the core insight that stayed) while fundamentally reimagining how it was taught and who held authority in the room. This kept the organization's coherence while genuinely adapting to changed contexts and membership.

**Example 2: The UK National Health Service's clinical governance evolution.** The NHS inherited rigid hierarchies from its founding (1948)—doctors made decisions, nurses and allied health professionals implemented them. By the 2000s, this structure was harming patients and burning out frontline staff. Rather than dismantling hierarchy entirely (which would have lost the benefits of clear escalation and accountability), NHS trusts that practiced this pattern created "governance forums" where clinicians from different disciplines examined specific decision points: Why does a doctor sign off on this? Has evidence changed such that someone else could do this safely? What would break if we shifted authority here? The result was selective evolution—some hierarchies were maintained (complex diagnostic decisions still required senior review), some were inverted (ward nurses gained decision authority on certain care protocols), and some were distributed (many decisions moved from individual authority to team-based judgment). The practice didn't eliminate tradition; it made it adaptive.

**Example 3: The Zapatista movement's rotating leadership structures.** The Zapatistas inherited and invented decision-making practices rooted in indigenous Mayan councils (tradition) and anarchist horizontalism (questioning). Rather than choosing between "elder wisdom" and "no leaders," they created something more complex: designated spokespersons who rotate frequently, councils that include both longtime insurgents and newer participants, and explicit forums where the tension between consensus-seeking and swift action is named and managed. They even institutionalized the questioning: certain voices are specifically invited to challenge proposals in real time, rather than suppressing dissent until it erupts. This structure has sustained the movement through decades and multiple generations of participants.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age where AI systems are increasingly embedded in decision-making, this pattern becomes more critical and more fragile.

**The new leverage:** AI can accelerate the archaeology phase. Large language models can help surface the reasoning behind inherited practices by analyzing documentation, interviews, and code comments. You can ask a system to trace why a particular approval workflow exists by analyzing tickets and emails from a decade back. This makes the hidden logic of tradition more visible more quickly, shortening the time required for the council to understand origin. This is genuine leverage.

**The new risk:** AI can also make the pattern obsolete if practitioners treat algorithmic "optimization" as authority that supersedes human judgment about what to preserve. An AI system might analyze a hiring process and recommend: "Remove the community conversation phase—it extends time-to-hire with no measurable impact on retention." This is technically true and fundamentally ignorant. That conversation phase may build belonging, distribute influence, or surface concerns that don't appear in quantifiable metrics. The risk is that efficiency becomes the criteria and the council's work—which is about balancing competing values, not optimizing single variables—gets bypassed.

**For product teams specifically:** Tech contexts face acute pressure here. An engineer might propose: "Rewrite this system from scratch using the latest architecture." The tradition-keeper says: "We can't; we don't understand all the implicit knowledge in this codebase." The questioner says: "But it's legacy and slow." The AI system says: "Feasible in 18 months with 90% feature parity." None of these statements are wrong, but they miss the council's actual work: what knowledge is embedded here? What would we lose? What would we gain? Can we evolve rather than replace? The pattern is how you make that judgment collectively rather than by assertion.

**The cognitive shift required:** In an AI-augmented context, this pattern actually becomes *more* necessary, not less. Because AI excels at optimization within defined parameters, humans need stronger shared practices for defining which parameters matter. The council becomes not just about honoring tradition but about defending values that don't reduce to metrics.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

Practitioners can articulate *why* a practice exists, not just what it is. You ask someone "why do we do code review?" and they give you a real answer ("to catch security vulnerabilities and spread knowledge") rather than "that's just how we work." This signals the pattern is alive—practices are held consciously, not by rote.

Decisions to evolve practices happen—not constantly, but regularly. You see practices that existed five years ago have genuinely changed form, or been retired, because the council examined them and made a reasoned choice. This isn't thrashing; it's discriminating continuity.

New members feel welcomed and can contribute to the system without first proving loyalty to inherited ways. Simultaneously, they ask genuine questions about tradition rather than treating elders as ornamental. This dual movement—newcomers learn the reasoning, elders learn new context—signals vitality.

**Signs of decay:**

The council exists but decisions never change anything. Every practice examined is judged "essential" or the examination gets postponed. The form persists without substance; it becomes a ritual of listening that doesn't lead to evolution.

Tradition-holders become defensive or resentful, experiencing all questioning as attack. Or questioners become cynical, assuming nothing will change so why bother showing up. When the pattern has hollowed, you see one side stop participating or participate purely to perform loyalty or opposition.

The system becomes rigid in either direction: either everything is locked in tradition-as-law, or everything churns constantly. Neither sustains vitality because neither balances transmission with adaptation. You see high turnover of people or constant restarts of failed initiatives—symptoms of a system that can't carry knowledge forward.

**When to replant:**

If you notice signs of decay, restart the practice by explicitly naming the failure. Gather the council and ask: "This forum isn't working. What would make it real?" Often the answer is smaller scope (examine fewer practices but more deeply) or different membership (include people actually experiencing the friction).

Replant immediately after a major transition—new leadership, new influx of members, merger, or significant change in context. This is when questions about tradition are most alive and most urgent. If you wait until the system has settled, you'll find the questions have been answered implicitly in ways you may not like.
