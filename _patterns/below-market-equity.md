# Below-Market + Equity

### 1. Overview

The Below-Market + Equity model is a compensation strategy predominantly utilized by early-stage startups and companies with limited cash flow. The core purpose of this model is to attract and retain talented individuals by supplementing a lower-than-average cash salary with equity in the company, typically in the form of stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs). This approach allows startups to compete for talent with larger, more established companies that can offer higher cash salaries. The problem this pattern solves is the critical challenge for new ventures to build a skilled and motivated team while managing a tight budget. By offering a stake in the company's future success, startups can align the financial interests of their employees with the long-term growth and profitability of the business.

The practice of offering equity as part of compensation has been a feature of the technology industry for decades, with its roots in the early days of Silicon Valley. Companies like Fairchild Semiconductor and later Apple and Microsoft popularized the use of stock options to incentivize employees and foster a sense of ownership. This model has since become a standard practice in the startup ecosystem globally. In the context of commons-aligned value creation, the Below-Market + Equity pattern can be a powerful tool. By distributing ownership among the people who contribute their labor and expertise, it can foster a more equitable and collaborative organizational culture. When employees are also owners, they are more likely to be engaged in the company's mission and to contribute to the creation of shared value. This aligns with the commons principle of shared ownership and governance, where the people who create the value also share in the rewards.

However, the effectiveness of this model in promoting a commons-aligned approach depends heavily on its implementation. If the equity distribution is fair and transparent, and if employees have a real voice in the company's governance, then it can contribute to a more democratic and participatory workplace. On the other hand, if the equity is concentrated in the hands of a few founders and early investors, or if the terms of the equity grants are opaque and unfavorable to employees, then it can simply replicate traditional hierarchical power structures. Therefore, while the Below-Market + Equity pattern has the potential to support commons-aligned value creation, its actual impact depends on the specific details of its implementation and the underlying values of the organization.

### 2. Core Principles

1.  **Shared Risk, Shared Reward:** Employees who accept a below-market salary are taking a personal financial risk on the company's future success. In return, they are offered a share of the potential rewards through equity ownership.
2.  **Alignment of Interests:** By making employees owners, their financial interests are directly aligned with the long-term success of the company. This encourages a more engaged and motivated workforce.
3.  **Talent Attraction and Retention:** Equity compensation allows startups to attract and retain top talent that they would otherwise be unable to afford. The vesting schedule of equity grants also serves as a retention mechanism.
4.  **Cash Preservation:** For early-stage companies, preserving cash is critical for survival and growth. This model allows them to defer a portion of their compensation expense.
5.  **Ownership Culture:** Distributing equity can foster a culture of ownership, where employees feel a greater sense of responsibility and commitment to the company's success.
6.  **Long-Term Focus:** Equity compensation encourages employees to think and act with a long-term perspective, as the value of their equity is tied to the company's long-term performance.

### 3. Key Practices

1.  **Determine a Fair Market Salary:** Before offering a below-market salary, it's essential to benchmark the market rate for the role to understand the size of the discount being offered.
2.  **Calculate the Equity Grant:** The amount of equity offered should be commensurate with the salary discount and the employee's role and experience. This often involves using a formula or a framework to ensure consistency and fairness.
3.  **Establish a Clear Vesting Schedule:** Equity is typically granted with a vesting schedule, most commonly a four-year period with a one-year cliff. This means the employee must stay with the company for at least one year to receive any equity, and the full grant is earned over four years.
4.  **Choose the Right Equity Vehicle:** The most common forms of equity compensation are stock options (ISOs and NSOs) and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs). The choice of vehicle has different tax implications for both the employee and the company.
5.  **Create an Employee Stock Option Pool (ESOP):** Companies need to set aside a certain percentage of their total equity for employees. This pool is typically between 10% and 20% of the company's total shares.
6.  **Communicate the Value of Equity Clearly:** It is crucial to educate employees about the potential value of their equity, the risks involved, and the mechanics of how it works. This includes explaining concepts like dilution, strike price, and liquidation events.
7.  **Offer Equity Refresh Grants:** To continue to incentivize and retain employees over the long term, companies can offer additional equity grants (refreshers) based on performance and tenure.
8.  **Provide Liquidity Opportunities:** While equity is illiquid for a long time, companies can explore options for providing partial liquidity to employees through secondary sales or tender offers, especially as the company matures.

### 4. Implementation

Implementing a Below-Market + Equity compensation model requires a thoughtful and structured approach. The first step is to establish a clear compensation philosophy that outlines how the company will balance cash and equity. This philosophy should be aligned with the company's values and its long-term vision. Once the philosophy is in place, the next step is to create a detailed plan for implementation. This includes determining the size of the employee stock option pool, deciding on the type of equity to offer, and establishing a framework for granting equity to new hires and existing employees. It is also important to seek legal and tax advice to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations.

When it comes to the practicalities of implementation, transparency and communication are key. Companies should develop clear and easy-to-understand documentation that explains the terms of the equity grants, including the vesting schedule, the strike price, and the potential for dilution. It is also important to provide employees with resources to help them understand the value of their equity and the risks involved. This can include workshops, one-on-one meetings, and access to financial advisors. Real-world examples of companies that have successfully implemented this model include many of the tech giants we know today, such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These companies all used equity compensation to attract and motivate their early employees, and this played a significant role in their success.

However, it is also important to be aware of the potential pitfalls of this model. If not implemented carefully, it can lead to feelings of unfairness and resentment among employees. For example, if the equity is not distributed in a fair and transparent manner, or if employees feel that they are not being adequately compensated for the risks they are taking. Therefore, it is essential to regularly review and update the compensation plan to ensure that it remains fair and competitive. By taking a thoughtful and transparent approach, companies can use the Below-Market + Equity model to build a highly motivated and engaged team that is committed to the long-term success of the business.

### 5. 7 Pillars Assessment

| Pillar | Score (1-5) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | 4 | The model's purpose is to enable the creation of new ventures by aligning the interests of the team with the success of the enterprise, which is a strong foundation for commons-oriented value creation. |
| Governance | 3 | While it can distribute ownership, it doesn't inherently guarantee democratic governance. The impact on governance depends on whether equity holders have meaningful voting rights and a voice in decision-making. |
| Culture | 4 | It can foster a strong ownership culture where team members feel like partners in the venture, which is highly conducive to a commons-oriented approach. |
| Incentives | 4 | The model provides a powerful incentive for long-term value creation and shared success, which is a core tenet of commons thinking. |
| Knowledge | 3 | The model itself does not directly address knowledge sharing, but an ownership culture can encourage more open and collaborative practices. |
| Technology | 3 | The model is technology-agnostic, but it is often used in the tech sector where open-source and collaborative technologies are common. |
| Resilience | 4 | By aligning the team around a shared goal and conserving cash, this model can increase the resilience of early-stage ventures. |
| **Overall** | **3.6** | **The Below-Market + Equity model has a medium to high alignment with the 7 Pillars. Its strength lies in its ability to foster an ownership culture and align incentives around long-term value creation. However, its full potential as a commons-building tool depends on its implementation, particularly with respect to governance and transparency.** |

### 6. When to Use

*   **Early-stage startups with limited cash flow:** This is the most common use case, as it allows new ventures to attract talent without a large payroll.
*   **Companies in high-growth industries:** The potential for significant equity appreciation is a powerful motivator for employees in industries with high growth potential.
*   **When building a founding team:** Offering significant equity stakes can help to attract co-founders and early employees who are willing to take a risk on a new venture.
*   **To foster a strong ownership culture:** This model can be used to create a culture where employees feel a sense of ownership and responsibility for the company's success.
*   **As a tool for employee retention:** The vesting schedule of equity grants can be a powerful tool for retaining key employees over the long term.
*   **In mission-driven organizations:** For companies with a strong social or environmental mission, this model can attract employees who are motivated by more than just a high salary.

### 7. Anti-Patterns and Gotchas

*   **Opaque or unfair equity distribution:** If the process for granting equity is not transparent and fair, it can lead to resentment and demotivation.
*   **Over-promising the value of equity:** It is important to be realistic about the potential value of equity and to communicate the risks involved.
*   **Complex and confusing equity agreements:** The terms of equity grants should be clear and easy to understand. Avoid using jargon and legalistic language.
*   **Lack of liquidity:** If employees have no way to realize the value of their equity, it can become a source of frustration. Companies should have a plan for providing liquidity in the future.
*   **Dilution:** Employees should be made aware of the potential for their ownership stake to be diluted in future funding rounds.
*   **Ignoring the importance of cash:** While equity is a powerful motivator, it is not a substitute for a fair cash salary. Companies should strive to pay a living wage and to increase salaries as the company grows.
