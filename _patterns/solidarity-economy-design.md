Creating economic relations based on solidarity, fair exchange, and ethical production—cooperatives, fair trade, community supported agriculture—as the foundation of commons value.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Cooperative Economics.

---

### Section 1: Context

Economic extraction persists as the default logic: supply chains optimised for shareholder return, labour treated as cost to minimise, resources drawn faster than regeneration cycles. Yet in pockets across sectors—agricultural networks, manufacturing collectives, digital platforms, public procurement—practitioners are building economic relations where value stays within the web of people and ecosystems that create it.

The system is fragmenting along value lines. Corporate consolidation isolates producers from end-users and profit from contribution. Simultaneously, movements and communities reject this isolation and build their own flows: cooperatives that return surplus to members, fair trade networks that price goods to sustain producer dignity, community-supported agriculture that ties eater to grower through season and risk. Government agencies now experiment with social procurement that favours ethical producers. Tech platforms experiment with cooperative ownership models and transparent algorithmic governance.

This fragmentation is not failure—it's the fertile ground where Solidarity Economy Design takes root. The pattern emerges wherever people ask: *Who benefits from this exchange? Who carries the risk? Can economic flows regenerate what they consume?* The tension is alive in every practitioner's choice: design for solidarity, or design for efficiency?

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Solidarity vs. Design.**

Solidarity demands that economic relations serve the flourishing of all participants and the systems they depend on. It insists on transparency, consent, mutual benefit, and long-term responsibility. It is relational, slow-moving, contextual. Solidarity resists standardisation because every ecosystem, every community, every producer-consumer dyad is different.

Design, conversely, seeks elegant systems that scale, replicate, and function reliably. Design wants clarity, modularisation, repeatable patterns. Good design is efficient—it reduces friction and waste. But standardised design strips context and erases relationship. A fair-trade certification that works in one region may impoverish another by imposing external metrics. A cooperative structure that thrives in one culture may fragment in another.

The break comes when practitioners choose: maximise reach and lose accountability, or maintain intimacy and stay small. When they sacrifice transparency for scalability. When they absorb the costs of relationality into unpaid labour, burning out the stewards. When certification systems designed to verify solidarity become bureaucratic gatekeeping that excludes smaller producers. When the platform algorithm designed to "fairly" distribute work actually obscures the extraction happening beneath it.

The unresolved tension leaves economic systems either too rigid to adapt, or too loose to hold value. Solidarity without design becomes fragile, vulnerable to predation and burnout. Design without solidarity becomes another optimization engine for extraction.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, make the values and flows of the economic system visible and contestable by the people who participate in it, designing governance and measurement methods that emerge from and remain accountable to the community they serve.**

Solidarity Economy Design resolves the tension by refusing to separate them. The key shift: *make solidarity a design constraint, not an afterthought.* Not a nice-to-have bolted onto an extraction engine, but the skeleton the entire system is built around.

This happens through three interlocking mechanisms:

**First, radical transparency of value flows.** Design systems where every participant can see where money goes, how decisions get made, who carries risk. In a cooperative, this means open books and real voice in surplus allocation. In a platform, it means algorithmic transparency—the code that decides payment and opportunity must be auditable by the workers. In CSA programs, it means members understand the seasonal costs and crop risks they're sharing. Transparency is not information dumping; it's making the hidden visible in forms people can act on.

**Second, participatory metrics.** Don't impose external measures of success (yield per hectare, profit margin, engagement rate). Co-design indicators that matter to the people in the system. Fair-trade producers themselves define what "fair" means in their context, not a distant certification body. Worker cooperatives measure vitality by retention and voice, not just throughput. This keeps design rooted in the actual soil of people's needs.

**Third, distributed ownership of both assets and decision rights.** Solidarity economy works when the people who create value also own stakes in the system and have real power over its direction. This might be formal co-ownership, or it might be genuine participatory governance with enforceable accountability. The mechanism: ensure feedback loops are short, local, and binding. When decisions affect you, you have voice and power proportional to your stake.

These three—transparent flows, participatory metrics, distributed ownership—work together as a living system. Each one fails without the others. Transparency without voice becomes voyeurism. Participation without ownership remains advisory. Ownership without transparency becomes capture.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

Cultivate solidarity economy in your context through these grounded moves:

**For organizations (corporate):** Map your actual value chain—every hand that touches the product or service, every ecosystem service you draw on. Name the current allocation: who gets paid, who carries risk, whose labour is invisible? Then deliberately redesign. If you're a food company, move from vendor relationships to producer partnerships: multi-year agreements with transparent pricing that covers true cost of sustainable production, not race-to-the-bottom. Establish a governance structure where producers have votes on product decisions, quality standards, and profit-sharing mechanisms. Audit your supply chain for hidden extraction—outsourced labour that is underpaid, ecological costs not priced in. Shift the metric from cost minimisation to value durability.

**For government (public service):** Use procurement as a solidarity lever. Design bid requirements that favour cooperatives, ethical manufacturers, and enterprises that certify fair wages and safe conditions. Don't just price on lowest cost; price on lifecycle value, worker welfare, and environmental regeneration. In benefit corporations and public agencies, establish participatory budgeting where service users and workers co-decide how resources get allocated. Create data commons where government service data is accessible to community researchers and movement builders, so power is readable and contestable. When you commission a platform or system, include algorithmic auditing rights for workers or users.

**For movements and activists:** Build economic infrastructure that outlasts individual campaigns. Start with producer networks—farmers, makers, craftspeople—and create direct distribution routes that eliminate middlemen: farmers markets, buying clubs, online platforms owned by sellers. Layer in mutual aid: when one producer has a bad season, the network shares the burden. Establish cooperative standards (not external certification) where members hold each other accountable. Use the visibility you gain to name systemic extraction: show the supply chain of conventional goods alongside your solidarity alternative, so the contrast becomes obvious. Document your model obsessively—measurement isn't compliance, it's learning fuel.

**For tech and platform builders:** Cooperativise ownership. Distribute equity to workers and users proportional to their contribution. Make the algorithm that determines work allocation, payment, or visibility auditable and changeable by the people affected—not through feedback channels, but through governance participation. Code the metrics that matter: worker scheduling autonomy, user data ownership, sustainable server use. When you add a new feature, force yourself to name who benefits and who bears cost. If you can't name a constituency that benefits and retains decision power over that feature, don't build it. Design for exit: ensure users can port their data and relationships out of your platform. Decentralise where possible—federation over monolithic platforms.

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

New forms of accountability emerge, replacing distant trust with readable relationships. Producers and consumers know each other by name and context. Workers see where their effort flows. Communities develop economic resilience—when one node struggles, the network bears it. Participatory metrics reveal what centralized KPIs hide: cultural value, ecological regeneration, wellbeing. People stay in work longer because they have voice and stake, reducing turnover and institutional knowledge loss. Innovation emerges from the people doing the work, not from distant strategy teams. Mutual aid becomes the norm, not the exception—people practise giving and receiving value continuously, strengthening solidarity bonds.

**What risks emerge:**

Solidarity Economy Design is slower and more labour-intensive than extraction-optimised systems. Coordination costs are real. Without careful boundaries, it can become a vehicle for unpaid emotional labour—especially from women in cooperative leadership. The pattern's low resilience score (3.0) signals vulnerability: solidarity networks can be fragile in the face of scale, competition, or burnout of core stewards. Participatory governance can stall in endless consensus-building or be captured by the loudest voices. Transparency can expose communities to predation if safeguards aren't in place. Fair-trade certification, when it becomes routinised and loses connection to actual producer voice, becomes hollow ritual. Watch for decay when solidarity metrics become checkbox compliance rather than living practice. The pattern also risks creating in-group/out-group dynamics—solidarity within your cooperative can coexist with indifference to those outside it. Finally, the pattern's low score on ownership and autonomy (both 3.0) reveals a real tension: cooperatives can become insular, resistant to the outside participation needed for true scale.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Mondragon Cooperative Corporation (Spain).** Established in 1956 in the Basque region, Mondragon is a federation of more than 80 worker cooperatives across manufacturing, retail, and services, with over 80,000 members. Every worker owns shares and votes on major decisions. Wage differentials are capped at 9:1 (executive to lowest-paid). Profits are distributed to workers based on tenure and role. Crucially, members govern through both local assembly and federated councils, ensuring decisions stay rooted in context while building network resilience. Mondragon has weathered recessions better than comparable private firms because workers have stake in long-term viability, not quarter-to-quarter extraction. The pattern has generated new adaptive capacity: facing automation, they invest in retraining rather than layoffs, because workers vote on such decisions. This is Solidarity Economy Design at scale, though not without tension: some newer cooperatives report governance fatigue, and the scale has created distance between federated centers and local assemblies.

**Equal Exchange (US, fair trade coffee and chocolate).** Founded in 1986, Equal Exchange is a worker-owned cooperative that sources directly from farmer cooperatives in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. They eliminated exploitative middlemen by building direct relationships with producer groups, transparency on pricing, and multi-year agreements that enable producers to invest in their farms. Farmers know exactly how much they'll be paid, can plan seasons accordingly, and have voice in product development. Equal Exchange itself is governed by workers who make decisions democratically. The model reveals the implementation point: transparency (publish exactly what price farmers get, what goes to operations, what to growth) makes solidarity auditable. The pattern has generated new economic infrastructure: producer cooperatives in origin countries have grown stronger because they deal with a buyer that respects their autonomy and shares data. Resilience remains modest—a single supply disruption can strain the network—but the system regenerates because relationships are built to weather shocks together.

**Platform Cooperativism (digital services).** Stocksy (photographer cooperative), Loomio (consensus platform), and Fairbnb.coop (hospitality) exemplify the tech translation. Stocksy members own the platform and vote on fees, policies, and direction. Photographers see where their work is used and receive higher commissions than conventional stock photo sites. Loomio is itself a worker-owned cooperative that helps other organisations design participatory decision-making. Fairbnb.coop gives hosts algorithmic transparency and voice in community governance, preventing the local-housing-destruction that Airbnb enabled. Each uses the same levers: distributed ownership, transparent algorithms, participatory metrics. The emergent capacity: these platforms attract users precisely because they *don't* extract. They're smaller than their corporate equivalents but more durable because members stay, refer others, and improve the product. The fragility: they lack the venture capital backing of competitors, so growth is slower and susceptible to being undercut by platforms that will extract more ruthlessly.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age of AI and algorithmic decision-making, Solidarity Economy Design faces a new pressure and a new opportunity.

**The pressure:** AI systems are trained on historical data, which encodes extraction. If you train an algorithm on conventional labour markets, it learns to compress wages and accelerate burnout. If you train it on conventional supply chains, it learns to optimise for cost at the expense of producer welfare. Platforms deploying AI to route work, set prices, or allocate resources risk automating the extraction while claiming neutrality—"the algorithm decided." This threatens solidarity's foundation: transparency. If the decision-making logic is opaque to the people affected, you've broken the contract.

**The opportunity:** AI can make hidden flows visible at scale. Natural language processing can audit supply chain transparency claims. Computer vision can verify ethical labour practices in factories. Distributed ledger systems can create immutable transparent records of value flows. Algorithmic auditing tools can help workers and communities understand and contest the systems that affect them. Cooperative platforms can use AI to improve coordination efficiency without compromising voice—better matching between producers and consumers, smarter resource allocation, faster consensus-finding through digital deliberation tools.

**The critical move:** In the cognitive era, make algorithmic decision-making itself a commons resource, not a proprietary asset. If an AI system routes work, prices goods, or allocates resources in a solidarity economy, the training data, decision trees, and performance metrics must be co-owned and participatory auditable. Don't hide the algorithm and claim neutrality. Publish it. Let workers and producers understand and contest it. Build feedback loops where the system learns not just from data, but from human judgment about what matters.

The Solidarity Economy Design pattern gains new leverage here: participatory metrics become easier to implement at scale through accessible dashboards. Transparency becomes verifiable through cryptographic audit trails. Distributed ownership becomes technically easier through cooperative tokenization. But it also gains new risks: the seductive simplicity of algorithmic decision-making can erode deliberative practice if we're not vigilant.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

People voluntarily stay in the system. Turnover is low; commitment is high. You see this in multi-decade membership in cooperatives, in communities fighting to keep alternative markets open even when corporate chains move in, in workers choosing cooperative platforms even when they pay slightly less but offer real voice. Transparent value flows generate trust—producers recommend the buyer to peers, workers reference-check the employer, consumers evangelize the brand. The network visibly self-corrects: when a producer or worker violates solidarity principles, the community holds them accountable and the person either reforms or leaves. New capacity emerges organically—producers innovate sustainable practices because they have stake; workers propose efficiency improvements because they benefit; users build community because they own it. Governance happens regularly and feels consequential—people attend meetings because decisions matter, not because attendance is mandatory.

**Signs of decay:**

Transparency becomes ritual; financial data is published but no one reads it or acts on it. Governance meetings feel performative—decisions are already made; participation is window dressing. Core stewards are exhausted, doing unpaid emotional labour to hold the system together. Metrics become checkbox compliance—you measure participation rates, not actual voice in decisions. The system becomes insular; the same people lead year after year because new members feel shut out. Conflicts are avoided rather than worked through, leading to silent resentment. External pressures (competition, regulation, resource scarcity) create pressure to abandon solidarity principles for efficiency gains, and the community is too tired to resist. Metrics that once emerged from members' values become externally imposed—a certification body defines "fair," a platform algorithm defines "merit," a funder defines "impact."

**When to replant:**

If you see decay, don't try to patch it. Convene the core community (not the leadership, the community) for a genuine reset conversation: *What brought us together? What are we trying to create together? Are we still serving that, or have we drifted?* If the answer is "we've drifted," you have a choice: recommit to solidarity and redesign for it, accepting slower growth and more intensive coordination, or acknowledge that the model no longer serves your context and transition gracefully. The wrong choice is to keep the form while the substance dies. Replant when energy renews—after a seasonal break, after bringing in new members with fresh perspective, after a visible win that reminds people why solidarity matters.
