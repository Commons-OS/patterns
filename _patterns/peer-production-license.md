## 1. Overview

The Peer Production License (PPL) is a type of license that modifies the principles of copyleft to create a new framework known as "copyfarleft." It is designed to allow for the free and open sharing of knowledge and creative works while simultaneously protecting those works from being co-opted by for-profit, capitalist entities. The PPL enables a system of reciprocal exchange within a commons-based economy, where those who contribute to the commons are able to freely use and build upon the collective works, while those who wish to profit from the commons without contributing are required to obtain a separate commercial license. This licensing model is a direct response to the perceived shortcomings of traditional copyleft licenses, which, while promoting sharing, do not adequately address the issue of commercial exploitation of the commons.

The PPL is a tool for building a more just and equitable economic system, one that is based on cooperation and mutual aid rather than competition and extraction. It is a legal hack that allows for the creation of a protected commons, a space where peer producers can collaborate and create without the fear of their work being appropriated by capital. The license is a practical application of the principles of open cooperativism and a key component of the transvestment strategy, which aims to shift resources and energy from the dominant capitalist system to a more sustainable and equitable commons-based alternative.

## 2. Core Principles

The Peer Production License is built upon a set of core principles that distinguish it from other licensing models. These principles are designed to foster a commons-based economy and protect the collective labor of peer producers.

At its heart, the PPL is based on the principle of **reciprocity**. This means that those who contribute to the commons are granted free access to the collective works, while those who do not contribute are required to pay for the privilege of using those works for commercial gain. This principle of reciprocity is a fundamental departure from traditional copyleft licenses, which allow for commercial use without requiring any form of contribution to the commons. The PPL, in contrast, creates a system of mutual exchange, where the benefits of the commons are shared among those who help to create and maintain it.

Another key principle of the PPL is the **protection of the commons from capitalist appropriation**. The license is explicitly designed to prevent for-profit companies from exploiting the free labor of peer producers. By restricting commercial use to cooperatives and other non-capitalist organizations, the PPL ensures that the value created by the commons remains within the commons. This is a crucial element of the license, as it addresses a key concern of many in the open-source and free-culture movements: the co-optation of their work by large corporations.

Finally, the PPL is based on the principle of **empowering workers and promoting economic democracy**. The license allows for commercial use by worker-owned cooperatives and other organizations where the producers themselves control the means of production and share in the profits of their labor. This is a direct challenge to the traditional capitalist model, where the owners of capital extract surplus value from the labor of workers. The PPL, by contrast, promotes a more equitable and democratic form of economic organization, where the people who create the value are also the ones who benefit from it.

## 3. Key Practices

The implementation of the Peer Production License involves a set of key practices that are essential for its effective use. These practices are not only about applying the license to a work but also about fostering a culture of cooperation and reciprocity within a commons-based community.

One of the most important practices is the **clear and consistent application of the license**. This means that all works produced within a commons should be licensed under the PPL, and this should be clearly communicated to all participants. This ensures that there is no ambiguity about the terms of use and that all contributors are aware of their rights and responsibilities. It is also important to provide a clear and accessible explanation of the license, so that people who are not familiar with it can easily understand its terms.

Another key practice is the **establishment of a system for managing commercial licenses**. Since the PPL allows for commercial use under a separate license, it is important to have a clear process for negotiating and granting those licenses. This may involve setting up a separate legal entity to handle licensing agreements, or it may be done on a more informal basis by the community itself. The revenue generated from commercial licenses can then be used to support the commons and its contributors.

Finally, it is important to **actively promote the use of the PPL and the principles of copyfarleft**. This can be done through education, outreach, and the development of resources and tools that make it easier for people to use the license. By spreading the word about the PPL and its benefits, it is possible to build a larger movement of peer producers who are committed to building a more just and equitable economic system. This includes creating and distributing documentation, giving workshops, and engaging in public discussions about the importance of protecting the commons from capitalist appropriation.

## 4. Application Context

The Peer Production License is most applicable in contexts where a community of peer producers wishes to create and maintain a protected commons. It is particularly well-suited for digital commons, such as open-source software projects, online knowledge repositories, and collaborative creative works. The PPL provides a legal framework for these communities to share their work freely among themselves while preventing its commercial exploitation by for-profit entities.

The effectiveness of the PPL is contingent upon the existence of a community that is committed to the principles of reciprocity and cooperation. The license is not a magic bullet that can create a commons out of thin air; rather, it is a tool that can be used to support and strengthen an existing community of peer producers. The PPL is most likely to be successful in situations where there is a shared understanding of the value of the commons and a collective desire to protect it from enclosure.

However, the PPL may not be the best choice for all situations. For projects that aim for the widest possible adoption, including by for-profit companies, a more permissive license, such as the MIT License or the Apache License, might be more appropriate. The PPL is a strategic choice for communities that prioritize the protection of the commons over the maximization of its reach. It is a license for those who are willing to trade a certain degree of mainstream adoption for the assurance that their work will not be used to generate private profits without reciprocity.

## 5. Implementation

Implementing the Peer Production License requires a series of deliberate steps to ensure that the license is correctly applied and that its principles are upheld. The process begins with the selection of the appropriate version of the license and its application to the work in question. The full text of the license should be included with the work, and a clear notice should be displayed to inform users of the terms of use.

Once the license has been applied, the next step is to establish a clear process for managing commercial licensing. This may involve the creation of a separate legal entity, such as a cooperative or a non-profit organization, to handle licensing agreements and collect royalties. The revenue generated from commercial licenses can then be used to support the commons and its contributors. It is important to have a transparent and democratic process for deciding how these funds are allocated.

In addition to the legal and administrative aspects of implementation, it is also crucial to foster a culture of reciprocity and cooperation within the community. This can be done through education, outreach, and the development of resources and tools that make it easier for people to contribute to the commons. By actively promoting the values of the PPL, it is possible to build a strong and vibrant community of peer producers who are committed to the principles of copyfarleft.

Finally, it is important to be prepared to enforce the terms of the license. This may involve taking legal action against companies that violate the terms of the PPL by using the work for commercial purposes without obtaining a license. While this may be a difficult and costly process, it is essential for protecting the integrity of the commons and ensuring that the principles of the license are respected.

## 6. Evidence & Impact

The Peer Production License has been adopted by a growing number of organizations and projects, providing evidence of its real-world impact. One of the most prominent examples is Guerrilla Translation, a collective of translators who use the PPL to license their translations of articles and books. This allows them to share their work freely with other non-profit and cooperative organizations while charging a fee for commercial use. The revenue generated from these commercial licenses is then used to support the work of the collective.

Another notable example is DisCO.coop, a platform for distributed cooperative organizations. DisCO.coop uses the PPL to license its software and other resources, ensuring that they remain within the commons and are not appropriated by for-profit companies. The use of the PPL is a key part of DisCO.coop's strategy for building a more just and equitable digital economy.

The impact of the PPL can also be seen in the growing conversation around the need for new licensing models that can protect the commons from commercial exploitation. The PPL has been instrumental in popularizing the concept of "copyfarleft" and has inspired other projects to develop similar licenses. This has led to a broader discussion about the future of intellectual property and the role of the commons in a digital age.

While the PPL has not yet achieved the same level of mainstream adoption as more permissive licenses, its impact can be seen in the way that it has shifted the conversation around open-source and free-culture licensing. The PPL has demonstrated that it is possible to create a licensing model that is both open and protective, and it has provided a practical tool for communities that are committed to building a more just and equitable economic system.

## 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

In the Cognitive Era, where knowledge and information are the primary drivers of economic value, the Peer Production License takes on a new level of significance. The increasing automation of labor and the rise of artificial intelligence are creating a situation where the value of human labor is being devalued. In this context, the PPL provides a mechanism for protecting the value of human creativity and collaboration.

The PPL is a tool for building a commons-based economy, which is seen by many as a viable alternative to the dominant capitalist system. In a commons-based economy, the means of production are owned and controlled by the producers themselves, and the value created by their labor is shared among them. This is in stark contrast to the capitalist model, where the owners of capital extract surplus value from the labor of workers.

The PPL is particularly relevant in the context of the growing movement for data sovereignty and the right to control one's own data. The license can be used to create data commons, where individuals can pool their data and share it with others on their own terms. This is a powerful way to resist the enclosure of data by large corporations and to create a more equitable and democratic digital economy.

As we move deeper into the Cognitive Era, the need for new models of economic organization will become increasingly urgent. The PPL provides a practical and effective tool for building a more just and sustainable future, one that is based on cooperation, reciprocity, and the power of the commons.

## 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

The Peer Production License is a powerful tool for building and protecting the commons. Its alignment with the principles of a commons-based economy can be assessed across seven key dimensions:

| Dimension | Alignment Score (1-5) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Openness & Access** | 4 | The PPL promotes openness and access within the commons, but restricts access for for-profit entities. This is a deliberate choice to protect the commons from exploitation. |
| **Participation & Governance** | 4 | The license encourages participation in the commons and promotes democratic governance by giving control to the producers themselves. |
| **Shared Value & Benefit** | 5 | The PPL is explicitly designed to ensure that the value created by the commons is shared among its contributors and not appropriated by outside entities. |
| **Sustainability & Resilience** | 4 | By enabling the creation of a protected commons, the PPL contributes to the long-term sustainability and resilience of commons-based communities. |
| **Decentralization & Federation** | 4 | The license is a tool for building a decentralized and federated network of commons, which can help to create a more resilient and equitable economic system. |
| **Ecological & Social Well-being** | 3 | While not explicitly focused on ecological and social well-being, the PPL contributes to these goals by promoting a more just and equitable form of economic organization. |
| **Legal & Ethical Frameworks** | 5 | The PPL is a legal and ethical framework that is specifically designed to support the commons and protect it from enclosure. |

**Overall Commons Alignment Score: 4/5**
