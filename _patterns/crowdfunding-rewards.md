# Crowdfunding (Rewards)

### 1. Overview

Reward-based crowdfunding is a model of raising capital from a large number of individuals, typically via an online platform, in exchange for non-financial rewards. The core purpose of this pattern is to enable creators, entrepreneurs, and organizations to fund their projects, products, or ventures by preselling them or offering other tangible incentives to their community of supporters. This approach democratizes fundraising by allowing anyone with a compelling idea to appeal directly to the public for financial backing, bypassing traditional gatekeepers like venture capitalists and banks. The problem it primarily solves is the early-stage funding gap, where promising but unproven ideas struggle to secure the necessary capital to get off the ground. By leveraging the power of the crowd, this pattern validates market demand, builds a community of early adopters, and provides the initial funds to turn a concept into a reality.

The modern form of reward-based crowdfunding emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s with the rise of the internet. The first notable instance is often attributed to the British rock band Marillion, who in 1997 funded their reunion tour through donations from fans online [1]. This success inspired the creation of the first dedicated crowdfunding platform, ArtistShare, in 2000. However, the model was popularized and brought into the mainstream by platforms like Indiegogo (founded in 2008) and Kickstarter (founded in 2009), which have since facilitated the funding of billions of dollars for millions of projects. In the context of commons-aligned value creation, reward-based crowdfunding offers a powerful mechanism for communities to collectively fund and steward resources and projects that serve their shared interests. It allows for the creation of goods and services that are not solely driven by profit motives but by the desire to create shared value and address community needs. This model can foster a sense of collective ownership and participation, aligning the incentives of the creators with the interests of their community of backers.

### 2. Core Principles

1.  **Direct Community Engagement:** The pattern is built on a direct relationship between the creator and their community of backers. This fosters a sense of connection and shared purpose, moving beyond a purely transactional exchange.
2.  **Reciprocity and Mutualism:** Backers are not simply donating; they are participating in a reciprocal exchange, receiving a reward for their contribution. This creates a mutualistic relationship where both the creator and the backer benefit.
3.  **Transparency and Openness:** Successful crowdfunding campaigns are typically characterized by a high degree of transparency. Creators share their vision, progress, and challenges openly with their backers, building trust and accountability.
4.  **Validation of Demand:** By asking people to contribute financially before a product is fully developed, the pattern provides a powerful way to validate market demand and reduce the risk of producing something that nobody wants.
5.  **Low Barrier to Entry:** Compared to traditional fundraising methods, reward-based crowdfunding has a relatively low barrier to entry, making it accessible to a wider range of creators and projects.
6.  **Narrative and Storytelling:** A compelling narrative is crucial for a successful crowdfunding campaign. The story behind the project, the passion of the creator, and the vision for the future are what inspire people to contribute.

### 3. Key Practices

1.  **Craft a Compelling Campaign Page:** This includes a clear and concise project description, a high-quality video, and engaging visuals that tell a story and connect with potential backers on an emotional level.
2.  **Offer a Tiered System of Rewards:** Provide a range of reward levels to cater to different levels of financial contribution. Rewards should be desirable, relevant to the project, and offer increasing value at higher tiers.
3.  **Set a Realistic Funding Goal and Timeline:** The funding goal should be the minimum amount needed to bring the project to life, and the campaign duration should be long enough to build momentum but short enough to create a sense of urgency (typically 30-60 days).
4.  **Utilize an "All-or-Nothing" (AON) Model:** This model, where funds are only collected if the goal is met, is a strong signal of the creator's commitment and reduces the risk for backers. It creates a powerful incentive for the community to rally behind the project to ensure it reaches its goal.
5.  **Build a Community Before Launching:** A successful campaign rarely starts from scratch. It is crucial to build an audience and a community of potential backers before the campaign goes live through social media, email lists, and other channels.
6.  **Maintain Regular and Transparent Communication:** Keep backers updated on the progress of the campaign and the project itself. Regular updates build trust and maintain engagement throughout the process.
7.  **Plan for Fulfillment and Post-Campaign Management:** The work doesn't end when the campaign is successful. It is essential to have a clear plan for producing and delivering the rewards, as well as for managing the ongoing relationship with the community of backers.
8.  **Leverage Stretch Goals:** Once the initial funding goal is met, introduce stretch goals to incentivize further contributions. These are additional features or rewards that will be unlocked if the campaign reaches higher funding levels.

### 4. Implementation

Implementing a reward-based crowdfunding campaign involves a series of strategic steps. The first phase is **pre-launch preparation**, which is arguably the most critical. This involves defining the project scope, creating a detailed budget to determine the funding goal, and building a community of potential supporters. During this phase, the creator should develop a compelling narrative and create all the necessary campaign assets, including the video, images, and a draft of the campaign page. The next step is to **choose the right platform**. Platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have different rules, fees, and community demographics, so it's important to select the one that best aligns with the project. Once the platform is chosen and the campaign page is built, the **campaign is launched**.

During the **live campaign phase**, the focus shifts to marketing and promotion. This involves actively reaching out to the pre-built community, engaging with potential backers on social media, and seeking press coverage. Regular updates should be posted to the campaign page to maintain momentum and keep backers engaged. If the campaign is successful and reaches its funding goal, the final phase is **post-campaign fulfillment**. This involves collecting the funds, producing the rewards, and delivering them to the backers. Clear and consistent communication is crucial during this phase, especially if there are any delays or challenges. A real-world example of successful implementation is the Pebble Time smartwatch, which raised over $20 million on Kickstarter in 2015. They had a clear product, a compelling video, a tiered reward system, and a strong pre-existing community from their first successful Kickstarter campaign.

### 5. 7 Pillars Assessment

| Pillar | Score (1-5) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | 4 | The pattern is strongly aligned with purpose-driven projects, enabling the creation of goods and services that address specific community needs and values, often outside of purely commercial interests. |
| Governance | 3 | While the creator retains ultimate control, the community of backers can exert significant influence through their funding decisions and feedback. However, formal governance structures are not inherent to the pattern. |
| Culture | 4 | It fosters a culture of collaboration, participation, and co-creation. Backers are not just consumers but are active participants in the project's journey. |
| Incentives | 4 | The pattern relies on a mix of intrinsic (supporting a cause) and extrinsic (receiving a reward) incentives, which can be a powerful combination for mobilizing a community. |
| Knowledge | 3 | Campaigns often involve sharing knowledge and progress openly, but the pattern does not inherently require the project's outputs to be open source or part of a knowledge commons. |
| Technology | 5 | The pattern is enabled by and heavily reliant on open and accessible web technologies and platforms that connect creators and backers globally. |
| Resilience | 3 | It can build resilience by diversifying funding sources and creating a strong community of support. However, it is also vulnerable to platform risks and the challenges of fulfilling promises to a large number of backers. |
| **Overall** | **4.0** | **Reward-based crowdfunding is a powerful tool for commons-aligned value creation, particularly in its ability to mobilize communities around shared purposes and foster a culture of participation. Its main limitations lie in the lack of formal governance structures and the potential for knowledge to remain proprietary.** |

### 6. When to Use

*   When you have a creative project (e.g., a film, album, or book) that needs funding to be produced.
*   When you are developing a new physical product and want to validate market demand and secure pre-orders.
*   When you are a startup with a strong community but lack the initial capital to get your venture off the ground.
*   When you want to launch a project that serves a specific community need and want to involve that community in the funding and creation process.
*   When you are looking for an alternative to traditional financing that allows you to retain full ownership and creative control.
*   When you want to build a community of early adopters and brand advocates around your project or product.

### 7. Anti-Patterns and Gotchas

*   **"If you build it, they will come":** Launching a campaign without a pre-existing community and a marketing plan is a recipe for failure.
*   **Underestimating Costs and Overpromising:** Setting an unrealistic funding goal or promising rewards that are too expensive or difficult to produce can lead to project failure and a damaged reputation.
*   **Poor Communication:** Going silent after the campaign ends or failing to be transparent about challenges can erode trust and lead to a backlash from backers.
*   **Scope Creep:** Adding too many stretch goals or making significant changes to the project after it has been funded can lead to delays and an inability to deliver on the original promise.
*   **Ignoring the Long Tail:** The majority of funding often comes in the first and last few days of a campaign. It's a mistake to become complacent in the middle period.
*   **Treating it as a Store:** Crowdfunding is not just a retail platform. Backers are supporting a creative process and expect to be treated as part of the journey, not just as customers.
