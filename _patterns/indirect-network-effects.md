# Indirect Network Effects

### 1. Overview

Indirect network effects, also known as cross-side network effects, describe a phenomenon where the value of a product or service increases for one group of users as a new user from a different group joins the network. This is a common characteristic of multi-sided platforms that bring together two or more distinct but interdependent groups of users. For example, the value of a video game console for gamers increases as more game developers create games for that console. Conversely, the value for game developers increases as more gamers adopt the console, creating a larger potential market for their games. This dynamic creates a positive feedback loop where growth on one side of the platform stimulates growth on the other, leading to a powerful, self-reinforcing cycle of value creation.

The core purpose of leveraging indirect network effects is to solve the classic "chicken-and-egg" problem that plagues new platforms. A new platform is not valuable to one group of users unless it has a critical mass of users from the other group, and vice versa. By understanding and strategically managing indirect network effects, startups can overcome this initial hurdle and build thriving ecosystems. The concept was significantly advanced in the 1980s and 1990s by economists and researchers like Michael L. Katz, Carl Shapiro, Joseph Farrell, and Garth Saloner, who formalized the theory of two-sided markets. Their work laid the foundation for understanding how platforms can strategically price their services and subsidize one side of the market to attract users and ignite the positive feedback loop.

In the context of commons-aligned value creation, indirect network effects can be a powerful tool for building platforms that distribute value more equitably among participants. While traditional platforms often use network effects to create monopolies and extract value, a commons-aligned approach focuses on creating shared infrastructure and governance models that empower users. By designing platforms where the value created by the network is reinvested in the community, rather than being captured solely by the platform owner, it is possible to build more resilient and equitable digital ecosystems. This approach emphasizes the role of the platform as a facilitator and a steward of the community, rather than a purely profit-maximizing entity.

### 2. Core Principles

1.  **Two-Sided Markets:** The pattern is fundamentally about creating value by connecting two distinct but interdependent groups of users. The platform acts as an intermediary, facilitating transactions and interactions between these two groups.

2.  **Cross-Side Externalities:** The value for one side of the market is a direct function of the number of users on the other side. This is the defining characteristic of indirect network effects and the engine of the positive feedback loop.

3.  **Subsidization Strategy:** To overcome the "chicken-and-egg" problem, it is often necessary to subsidize one side of the market. This can involve offering free or discounted access to one group of users to attract a critical mass, which in turn makes the platform more attractive to the other group.

4.  **Positive Feedback Loops:** Once a critical mass of users is reached on both sides, a virtuous cycle begins. More users on one side attract more users on the other, which in turn attracts even more users to the first side, leading to exponential growth.

5.  **Platform as Intermediary:** The platform's primary role is to reduce transaction costs and make it easier for the two sides to connect and interact. This can involve providing tools for search, communication, payment, and trust-building.

6.  **Critical Mass:** The pattern only becomes effective after the platform reaches a critical mass of users on both sides. Before this point, the network is not valuable enough to attract new users, and the platform may struggle to gain traction.

### 3. Key Practices

1.  **Identify and Target Two Sides:** The first step is to clearly define the two user groups that the platform will serve. This requires a deep understanding of the market and the specific needs of each group.

2.  **Solve the "Chicken-and-Egg" Problem:** There are several strategies for solving this problem, including subsidizing one side of the market, creating standalone value for one side first, or "faking" one side of the market by, for example, manually creating listings or profiles.

3.  **Develop a Strategic Pricing Model:** The pricing model should be designed to encourage participation on both sides of the market. This often involves a "subsidy side" that pays less (or nothing) and a "money side" that pays for access to the other side.

4.  **Facilitate High-Quality Interactions:** The platform should provide tools and features that make it easy for the two sides to connect and transact. This includes features for search, filtering, messaging, and payment processing.

5.  **Build Trust and Safety:** Because the platform is an intermediary, it is responsible for the quality of interactions. This requires implementing mechanisms for building trust and safety, such as user reviews, identity verification, and dispute resolution.

6.  **Establish Clear Governance Rules:** The platform should have clear rules and governance for participation. This includes terms of service, community guidelines, and a process for enforcing these rules.

7.  **Use Data to Optimize the Platform:** The platform should collect and analyze data on user behavior to understand how the two sides are interacting and to identify opportunities for improvement. This data can be used to optimize the platform for both sides and to improve the overall user experience.

8.  **Focus on a Niche:** When starting out, it can be effective to focus on a specific niche or vertical. This makes it easier to reach critical mass and to build a strong community before expanding to other markets.

### 4. Implementation

Implementing a strategy based on indirect network effects requires a thoughtful and phased approach. The first step is a thorough market analysis to identify a market with the potential for a two-sided platform. This involves identifying two distinct groups of users with unmet needs that can be served by a common platform. Once a promising market has been identified, the next step is to design the platform and its core features. The design should focus on creating a seamless and intuitive user experience that makes it easy for the two sides to connect and interact.

With the platform designed, the most critical phase is seeding the network. This involves implementing a strategy to attract the first users on both sides of the market. As mentioned, this often involves subsidizing one side of the market. For example, a new ride-sharing app might offer bonuses to the first drivers who sign up, in order to build up a supply of drivers that will attract riders. Another strategy is to create standalone value for one side of the market. For example, a new software platform might initially offer a useful tool for developers, and then later open up the platform to users who can benefit from the applications created by those developers. Once a critical mass of users has been reached, the focus shifts to scaling the network by growing both sides in parallel and introducing a monetization strategy.

A classic example of successful implementation is Airbnb. In its early days, Airbnb faced the challenge of attracting both hosts and guests. To solve this, they focused on attracting hosts first by offering free professional photography services. This improved the quality of the listings and made the platform more attractive to guests. As more guests joined the platform, it became more valuable for hosts, who were then more likely to list their properties. This created a powerful virtuous cycle that has allowed Airbnb to grow into a global hospitality giant. This example illustrates the importance of a creative and strategic approach to solving the "chicken-and-egg" problem and igniting the power of indirect network effects.

### 5. 7 Pillars Assessment

| Pillar | Score (1-5) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | 4 | Indirect network effects can be used to create platforms that serve a clear social or environmental purpose, but they can also be used to create purely commercial platforms. The alignment with a commons purpose depends on the specific mission and governance of the platform. |
| Governance | 3 | The governance of platforms with indirect network effects can be centralized or decentralized. A commons-aligned approach would favor a more decentralized and participatory governance model, but this is not inherent to the pattern itself. |
| Culture | 4 | Platforms with indirect network effects can foster a strong sense of community and collaboration among users. However, the culture of the platform is shaped by the design and policies of the platform owner. |
| Incentives | 4 | The incentives in a platform with indirect network effects are designed to encourage participation and growth. A commons-aligned approach would ensure that the incentives are fair and equitable for all participants. |
| Knowledge | 3 | Platforms with indirect network effects can facilitate the sharing of knowledge and information among users. However, the platform owner typically controls the data and algorithms, which can limit the transparency and accessibility of knowledge. |
| Technology | 4 | The technology behind platforms with indirect network effects can be open or closed. A commons-aligned approach would favor open source technology and open data to promote transparency and interoperability. |
| Resilience | 4 | Platforms with strong network effects can be very resilient, as they are difficult to displace once they have reached critical mass. However, this can also lead to a lack of competition and a concentration of power. |
| **Overall** | **3.6** | **Indirect network effects are a powerful pattern for building platforms and ecosystems. While they have often been used to create extractive monopolies, they have the potential to be a key building block of a more commons-oriented economy if they are combined with a commitment to shared ownership, participatory governance, and equitable value distribution.** |

### 6. When to Use

*   When building a multi-sided platform that connects two or more distinct but interdependent groups of users.
*   When entering a market with a "chicken-and-egg" problem, where the value of the product or service depends on the number of users.
*   When the goal is to create a self-reinforcing cycle of growth and value creation.
*   When building a platform in a market where there are significant economies of scale in demand.
*   When there is an opportunity to create a new market or to disrupt an existing market by connecting previously disconnected groups.
*   When building a platform that can benefit from a large and diverse ecosystem of complementary products or services.

### 7. Anti-Patterns and Gotchas

*   **Focusing on the wrong side of the market:** It is crucial to identify which side of the market to subsidize and which side to charge. Getting this wrong can kill the platform before it even gets started.
*   **Failing to reach critical mass:** If the platform fails to attract a critical mass of users on both sides, the network effect will not kick in, and the platform will likely fail.
*   **Ignoring the quality of interactions:** It is not enough to simply connect two groups of users. The platform must also ensure that the interactions are high-quality and that both sides are getting value.
*   **Creating a "leaky bucket":** If the platform is not able to retain users, it will be difficult to reach critical mass and to sustain the network effect.
*   **Underestimating the competition:** Even with a strong network effect, it is important to be aware of the competition and to have a strategy for differentiation.
*   **Becoming a victim of your own success:** Rapid growth can put a strain on the platform and can lead to problems with performance, reliability, and customer support. It is important to have a plan for scaling the platform to meet the demands of a growing user base.
