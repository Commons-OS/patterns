Neurotypical people recognise the advantages their brains hold in systems designed around their cognitive patterns, and commit to treating neurodiversity as a source of collective intelligence rather than deviation.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Neurodiversity.

### Section 1: Context

Organisations, movements, and digital systems are built on invisible scaffolding: meeting formats, communication rhythms, hiring criteria, interface design, and decision-making processes that reward certain neurotypes while penalising others. A neurotypical person—someone whose attention, executive function, social processing, and sensory experience align with what these systems expect—rarely sees this scaffolding. They experience the system as neutral, not designed. Meanwhile, autistic, ADHD, dyslexic, and multiply-neurodivergent people experience constant friction: "Why can't I focus in open offices?" "Why are video meetings exhausting?" "Why does the application assume I process language linearly?" The collective intelligence commons is fragmenting. Organisations lose talent, perspective, and problem-solving capacity. Movements misintune to their own members' rhythms. Digital products exclude significant populations. The pattern emerges where neurotypical people are willing to examine their position—to see the scaffolding they've been standing on invisibly—and to understand that privilege in cognitive design is not personal failure but a structural reality that can be reshaped.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Neurotypical vs. Examination.**

Neurotypicality is not a neutral baseline; it is a privilege baked into institutional design. Neurotypical people experience this system as "how things are done," which makes privilege invisible. Examination requires stopping, looking at the ground beneath you, and naming what you've been benefiting from without noticing. This is uncomfortable. It risks shame, defensiveness, or performative guilt that exhausts neurodivergent people who then become educators rather than contributors. The tension: neurotypical people want to belong, contribute, and feel competent within existing systems. But those same systems systematically exclude neurodivergent colleagues. Examining privilege means admitting you've been moving faster because the maze was already mapped for your brain. It means acknowledging you can't "just focus" because your neurology allows it—and that your ease is another's invisible labour. Without examination, neurotypical people remain oblivious architects of exclusion. With examination but no structural change, the pattern becomes performative: "We acknowledge neurodiversity" while meetings stay at 8am, deadlines stay rigid, and interfaces stay visual-only. The commons cannot flourish while a majority cohort remains unconscious of the systems they inhabit.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, neurotypical people deliberately examine their cognitive assumptions, name what they're not struggling with, and translate that awareness into redesigning shared systems so they function for genuinely plural neurotypes.**

This pattern works by making the invisible visible, then using that clarity as leverage for genuine redesign. When a neurotypical manager realises that her ability to sustain focus in an open office is not a universal capacity but a neurotype-specific trait, she stops attributing focus problems to laziness or weakness. She sees the problem differently: the system is miscalibrated. From there, redesign becomes possible—quiet work zones, asynchronous communication options, choice in meeting formats—not as special accommodations but as pluralised system design.

The mechanism is cognitive empathy rooted in structural honesty. A neurotypical engineer examining his privilege around language processing might recognise that he's never had to decode ambiguous instructions; he naturally extrapolates intent. When a neurodivergent colleague asks for written confirmation of every assumption, he no longer hears "difficult" but hears the system being imprecise. He moves from accommodation (tolerating an outlier) to calibration (making the system actually clear). The shift is from "accommodating difference" to "designing for range."

This pattern is particularly vital in commons contexts because neurodiversity is not scarcity—it's richness. A system calibrated only for neurotypical processing loses autistic pattern recognition, ADHD hyperfocus, dyslexic spatial reasoning, and the polyphonic thinking that emerges when many cognitive styles engage together. Neurotypical privilege examination is the act of reallocating design power: from those who've been designing unconsciously toward those whose needs have been rendered invisible. It treats the commons as a living system with multiple roots, not a monoculture. The roots grow stronger when the soil serves all of them.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

Begin with **mapping the invisible**. In a corporate context, audit your actual operations: When do meetings happen? (8am assumes good sleep regulation.) What modalities dominate? (Video assumes comfort with sustained eye contact and audio without background noise.) How are decisions documented? (Ephemeral Slack threads exclude async thinkers.) Who speaks in meetings, and who writes proposals later? (Neurotypical privilege often shows as verbal fluency in real-time, which rewards certain processing speeds.) Assign one person to shadow a neurodivergent employee or contractor for a week and document where friction occurs.

In **government and public service**, create a neurodiversity impact assessment for every policy and process, the way you'd do climate impact or equity review. Before rolling out a new licensing system, ask: Does this require real-time decision-making, or can people step back and return? Does it assume literacy level X? Does it rely on sensory channels that not everyone has? For permit applications, service hours, and public meetings—all assume a neurotypical rhythm. Redesign proactively.

In **activist and movement contexts**, examine meeting culture explicitly. Activist spaces often pride themselves on accessibility but stop at physical ramps. Neurodiversity audit asks: Do we have real-time meetings or recorded options? Spoken agendas or written agendas? Do we assume people attend every meeting, or do we build in asynchronous participation? Who burns out? Track it. The people leaving your movement are often the ones whose neurology isn't served by your rhythm.

In **tech product design**, build neurodiversity testing into your QA process. Don't ask "Is this accessible?" Ask "Does this work for someone with attention regulation differences, auditory processing issues, or non-linear reading patterns?" Test with actual neurodivergent users early and continuously, not as an afterthought. Pay them. Test darkmode, distraction-free modes, text-scaling, audio alternatives, and linear navigation paths. When your interface requires you to hold three things in working memory at once, it's not inclusive—it's neurotypical-privileged.

Then **normalise naming**. In corporate all-hands: "We're moving to hybrid standup because real-time verbal updates exclude people whose speech comes slower, or who need processing time, or whose environment doesn't support audio." In government: "This form now has both visual and text-only versions because not everyone's visual system works the same way." In activism: "We record all meetings because your brain's memory is valid whether it's audio or written memory." In tech: "We built offline-first features because relying on constant connectivity privileges people without sensory overwhelm in always-online spaces."

Create **neurodiversity design guilds**—small, intentional groups mixing neurotypes (with genuine power, not token inclusion). Ask them to redesign one process per quarter. Pay participants. In corporate: redesign the hiring rubric. In government: redesign the public comment process. In activism: redesign meeting structure. In tech: choose one user flow and rebuild it. The point is neurotypical people learn by doing alongside neurodivergent people, not by reading guidelines.

Finally, **measure what matters**. Track retention of neurodivergent people. Track contribution patterns: Are quieter thinkers' ideas showing up in decisions, or are louder neurotypes still dominating? In tech, measure usage across neurodivergent user groups specifically, not just overall adoption. The metrics reveal whether your examination converted to real change.

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

New collaborative capacity emerges. When systems stop penalising certain cognitive styles, they unlock problem-solving approaches that neurotypical-designed systems miss. Autistic employees often bring systematic, pattern-based thinking; ADHD people often bring real-time adaptive reframing; dyslexic people often bring spatial and structural reasoning. These aren't compensations—they're different intelligences. Organisations that genuinely pluralise their systems see faster innovation and more robust decision-making. Retention improves dramatically. Neurodivergent people who've been burning out trying to mask or compensate have energy left for actual contribution. Teams feel less fractured. The shame and invisibility lift. People can name what they need without that naming being weaponised.

**What risks emerge:**

The pattern can calcify into performative ritual. A company audits its neurotypical privilege, creates a Neurodiversity Task Force that meets quarterly, publishes a neurodiversity statement, and changes nothing structural. The meetings still happen at 8am. The interface still requires real-time navigation. The governance still expects verbal consensus. Performative examination without redesign exhausts neurodivergent people, who must now repeatedly explain why nothing changed. Watch for this: If you're still measuring success by "how inclusive the conversation about inclusion is" rather than "did the actual system shift," you're hollow.

Resilience scores are deliberately low here (3.0). This pattern sustains existing health but doesn't generate new adaptive capacity on its own. It can become a maintenance ritual that *appears* to address neurodiversity without building genuine system flexibility. The risk is that examination becomes a box to tick rather than a practice that continuously regenerates system design. Organisations can also swing to overcorrection—so focused on removing "neurotypical bias" that they create inflexible alternative systems that now exclude other neurotypes. Plurality, not replacing one standard with another, is the goal.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**1. The UK Civil Service Neurodiversity Programme (2016–present)**

Civil Service leaders examined how their recruitment, retention, and promotion systems systematically rewarded neurotypical traits: interview performance under time pressure, rapid verbal communication, formal credential trajectories. They redesigned hiring to include written tests, structured questions, and interview accommodations. They extended probation for autistic employees who needed longer to navigate unfamiliar culture. They built quiet workspaces as default, not exception. The result: significant neurodivergent recruitment, particularly in analytical and technical roles. The examination wasn't performative because it moved from "How do we accommodate outliers?" to "How do we design systems that work for plural cognition?" Retention of neurodivergent civil servants improved measurably.

**2. Gitlab's Async-First Culture (product/tech context)**

Gitlab's leadership examined a privilege assumption: that real-time collaboration—synchronous meetings, rapid Slack responses, impromptu whiteboarding—was the height of collaboration and efficiency. They discovered this privileged neurotypes with fast speech-to-thought translation and comfort with constant social navigation. They rebuilt their entire product and workplace around asynchronous-first work: written proposals before meetings, recorded decisions, threaded conversations that move at different paces. Neurodivergent employees (and many neurotypical ones) reported less burnout. The product itself became more accessible. This wasn't accommodation; it was structural redesign based on examining what neurotypical real-time culture had been taking for granted.

**3. Disability Justice Activist Networks (activist context)**

Movements like Care Work and Disability Justice collectives examined how typical activist meetings—evening events in non-accessible spaces, expecting physical presence, rapid-fire verbal sharing, decision-making under time pressure—excluded disabled and neurodivergent people. They redesigned: daytime meetings in accessible spaces, written agendas circulated weeks in advance, silent protest options, decision-making via document collaboration, breaks built in. The examination wasn't "How do we include disabled people?" but "Why did we design this for people without disabilities?" Once redesigned, these meetings attracted broader participation, more careful thinking, and longer-term commitment. Burnout decreased.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

AI and distributed systems are reshaping neurotypical privilege in ways this pattern must adapt to. Historically, neurotypical privilege centred on real-time social performance and rapid language processing—skills that neurotypical neurology excels at and that organisations rewarded. AI is democratising some of these skills (language generation, real-time synthesis) while simultaneously creating *new* neurotypical privileges around comfort with constant AI mediation.

A neurotypical knowledge worker may comfortably hand over email drafting to an AI model, trusting it to capture their intent. A neurodivergent person who uses AI text-to-speech or written output precisely *because* real-time language isn't their strength may be less comfortable trusting an AI model's interpretation of intent. New privilege: comfort with black-box intermediaries.

In **tech product design**, this means neurotypical privilege examination must now examine AI interaction patterns. Does your AI assistant assume synchronous preference? Does it reward fast back-and-forth dialogue, or does it support asynchronous querying? Does it assume users can evaluate AI output against their intention, or does it build in checkpoints for people who need external validation? The interface between human and AI is a new design surface where neurotypical assumptions hide.

In **corporate contexts**, AI-assisted hiring (résumé screening, interview analysis) often embeds neurotypical bias at scale. Examination requires auditing: Does the AI model reward verbal fluency in interviews? Does it downrank candidates with nonlinear career paths (common for neurodivergent people who've masked or changed roles)? Does it expect certain communication styles? Building AI systems without neurodiversity examination multiplies the invisibility.

The leverage is that **distributed, asynchronous systems—which AI can coordinate—naturally fit neurodivergent work patterns better than real-time synchronous systems**. A pattern that treats AI as a tool for genuinely plural cognition (not just acceleration of neurotypical speed) can regenerate the commons. But only if neurotypical people examine their new privilege around comfort with AI mediation.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

Neurodivergent people stay. Turnover drops noticeably in roles where neurotypical privilege examination has led to actual redesign. Listen for phrases like "I don't have to mask here" or "My working style is the default, not the exception." Decisions shift in character: written reasoning appears before meetings. Silence in meetings becomes normal, not awkward. People name their processing needs without shame ("I'll respond to this in writing tomorrow," not "Sorry, I'm slow"). Contribution patterns broaden: quieter thinkers' ideas surface. Productivity metrics show no decline (often improve) even though the pace feels slower. The system feels less brittle.

**Signs of decay:**

Neurotypical people talk about neurodiversity constantly but nothing structural changed. Neurodivergent employees are still burning out. Meetings are still real-time-dependent. The hiring rubric still rewards fast verbal communication. Neurodivergent people are tired of explaining. A neurodiversity working group exists but has no budget and no power to redesign systems. The pattern has become a story you tell—"We're neurodiversity-aware"—rather than a practice you do. Retention drops again. Neurodivergent people leave quietly.

**When to replant:**

If decay shows, stop examining and start redesigning. Schedule a redesign sprint focused on one high-friction system: hiring, meetings, async communication, interface design. Give it real resources and decision-making power. If the pattern is working but rigidifying—becoming routine rather than alive—add new voices to the examination. Bring in recently hired neurodivergent people who see what's still broken. Change the guild members quarterly so fresh perspective keeps entering. The pattern stays vital when examination continuously regenerates into redesign, not when it becomes a checked box.
