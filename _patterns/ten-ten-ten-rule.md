Evaluate decisions by asking how you'll feel about them in 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years to balance short-term emotion with long-term perspective.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)

### Section 1: Context

Financial decisions in commons-stewarded systems fracture across time horizons. A cooperative faces an immediate cash crisis that tempts it toward a predatory loan. A land trust confronts pressure to sell timber rights for quarterly revenue. An activist collective debates whether to spend precious resources on visible action or patient infrastructure-building. Across all these domains, the system experiences a peculiar vertigo: the emotional weight of *now* drowns out the ecological weight of *later*. The living commons—whether financial, ecological, or social—deteriorates not from dramatic ruptures but from accumulated micro-decisions made in affective storms. The Ten-Ten-Ten Rule emerges in domains (corporate, government, activist, tech) where time-blindness is endemic. It offers a simple anchor: a way to let multiple timeframes speak simultaneously, so that the short-term nervous system doesn't hijack the long-term immune system.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Ten vs. Rule.**

The tension is felt as *immediacy vs. sustainability*. Ten-minute emotion is real and legitimate—it's the felt urgency of cash flow, the panic of a deadline, the seduction of a quick win. Rules, by contrast, feel cold, abstract, future-focused. When someone says "we need a rule," it often means *I want to override your emotion with constraint*. But enforcement of rule without understanding ten-minute reality breeds resentment and hollow compliance.

The commons breaks when either pole wins absolutely. Pure ten-minute decisions shred long-term viability: a mutual aid network burns out its volunteers by running purely on immediate need. Pure rule-making alienates participants and kills the adaptive responsiveness that living systems require.

The real crack emerges when there is *no shared language for time*—when some stakeholders are implicitly operating on quarterly returns while others think in seven-year forest cycles. Decisions made in this fog of misaligned timeframes feel arbitrary and demoralizing to those not aligned with the dominant temporal frame. The pattern breaks down when the rule becomes mechanistic ritual rather than a living practice of collective sense-making.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, the steward anchors decision-making by explicitly asking stakeholders three time-horizon questions—how will this feel in 10 minutes, 10 months, 10 years—and treats each answer as legitimate data about what the system needs.**

This isn't a tiebreaker formula. It's a *cultivation practice* that changes what information becomes visible. By naming all three timeframes simultaneously, you create a space where emotion isn't suppressed but re-contextualized. The ten-minute fear isn't silenced; it's held alongside the ten-month pattern and the ten-year trajectory.

The mechanism works through *temporal translation*. When a stakeholder articulates "In 10 minutes I'll feel relieved but ashamed" and "In 10 months I'll feel trapped" and "In 10 years I'll see this as the moment we lost coherence," they move from private anxiety into collective mapping. The rule becomes not a constraint imposed from above but an emergent recognition: *we can see the decay pattern together*.

In living systems language, this pattern is a *feedback loop*. The commons' health depends on the ability to feel consequences across different growth cycles—the soil's seasonal rhythm, the forest's generational rhythm, the organism's daily rhythm. Most human institutions operate with stunted feedback loops. They feel today's profit but not next decade's erosion. The Ten-Ten-Ten Rule forcibly restores the sensory apparatus: it makes the system permeable to its own future.

This draws directly from Suzy Welch's insight that decision-making quality improves when we interrupt the tyranny of the immediate by anchoring to multiple futures. The pattern is also fractal: it can be applied to a single transaction, a policy shift, or a constitutional change.

### Section 4: Implementation

**In corporate contexts (Time-Horizon Decision Making):**
Stop treating quarterly earnings as the only signal. Before approving a major capital allocation, have the CFO, the frontline worker, and the sustainability officer each answer the three questions aloud in a meeting. Document their answers. This surfaces that the CFO sees short-term shareholder value but 10-month risk of reputation damage and 10-year risk of regulatory exposure. The frontline worker might feel immediate burnout relief from automation but 10-month job insecurity and 10-year skill obsolescence. Let these sit in tension. The decision isn't to average them—it's to design around all three. A worker cooperative used this before automating a packing line: they discovered that without the 10-year horizon articulated, they would have eliminated the skill base that makes them competitive.

**In government contexts (Policy Time Horizon Analysis):**
Institute a mandatory "three-timeframe impact statement" for any policy affecting commons resources (water, land, information). A permitting decision that feels good in 10 minutes (job creation) might feel bad in 10 months (water depletion) and catastrophic in 10 years (aquifer collapse). Require the agency to articulate all three, then defend the decision anyway if they choose it. This prevents the typical government pathology where a minister makes a politically expedient move that poisons the system for the next administration. A small city applied this to a proposed industrial development: 10-minute benefit (tax revenue), 10-month risk (infrastructure strain), 10-year cost (groundwater contamination). The framework forced them to design mitigation instead of pretending the tradeoff didn't exist.

**In activist contexts (Long-View Activism):**
Use the rule to prevent burnout and scandal. Before committing resources to a campaign, ask the team: "How will we feel in 10 minutes if this action lands?" (Often: adrenaline, visibility.) "In 10 months?" (Often: secondary impact, legal consequences, funder response.) "In 10 years?" (Often: did this actually shift the system or did it accelerate its resistance?) A housing justice collective used this before a direct action and realized their 10-minute emotional high would become 10-month trauma (arrests, community fracture) and 10-year strategic liability (burned bridges with municipal allies). They didn't abandon action—they redesigned it toward approaches that felt good at all three horizons.

**In tech contexts (Time Perspective AI):**
Build the three-horizon question into your product decision-making framework. Model each feature or algorithm change through these three lenses. A recommendation algorithm might feel good in 10 minutes (engagement spike), feel bad in 10 months (filter bubble feedback), and feel terrible in 10 years (cultural polarization). Name it explicitly. Some AI teams now run "temporal impact reviews" where the data scientist, product manager, and ethics advisor each score the same decision across timeframes. Disagreement becomes data, not obstruction.

**Mechanical steps all contexts can use:**
1. Identify the decision. State it as a single sentence.
2. Go silent for two minutes. Let people sit with their own felt response.
3. Ask each voice in the room: "How will you feel about this in 10 minutes? In 10 months? In 10 years?" Take notes without interpretation.
4. Map the responses on three columns. Don't debate; just see.
5. Make the decision. (The rule doesn't dictate the answer—it clarifies what you're trading.)
6. Document what actually happened at 10 months. Adjust accordingly.

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

The commons gains *temporal integrity*. Decisions stop feeling arbitrary because stakeholders can see the time-horizon logic. Trust in decision-making regenerates when people feel heard across multiple futures. In a worker cooperative, the Ten-Ten-Ten Rule shifted the conversation from "management is hiding something" to "we're all looking at different clocks." New capacity emerges: the ability to design decisions that don't sacrifice one timeframe for another. A land trust learned to structure timber harvests so that 10-minute cash flow, 10-month regeneration, and 10-year biodiversity all strengthened simultaneously. The pattern also creates *accountability transparency*: when you've named what you're trading, it's harder to pretend the tradeoff didn't exist.

**What risks emerge:**

The pattern can calcify into ritual. If the three questions become a checkbox exercise, the practice dies. Teams begin answering by rote, without genuine reflection. The resilience score of 3.0 flags this vulnerability: the pattern sustains existing function but doesn't build adaptive capacity under genuine novelty. When environments shift fast (market collapse, climate shock, political rupture), the ten-month and ten-year timescales themselves become unreliable. Another risk: *temporal colonization*, where powerful stakeholders assert that their timeframe is the "real" one. A funder might argue that 10-year consequences don't matter because regulation will change, thus silencing longer-view voices. The pattern also demands psychological safety—if people fear retaliation for articulating unpopular timeframes, they'll say what they think you want to hear. Finally, the rule can mask structural inequality. If the person experiencing the 10-minute hardship isn't in the room, the temporal framework can become a tool of abstraction that papers over real suffering.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Case 1: A Seattle worker cooperative food distribution network**
In 2019, the cooperative faced pressure to adopt automated sorting technology. The equipment would cost $80K, eliminating three full-time packing jobs but reducing order-processing time from six hours to three. The typical tech-driven narrative was pure 10-minute thinking: faster is better. The cooperative used Ten-Ten-Ten. In 10 minutes, the system felt faster and more efficient. In 10 months, the three displaced workers weren't reabsorbed (local job market was tight), causing internal tension and loss of institutional knowledge about customer relationships. In 10 years, the cooperative realized it had eliminated the very skill differentiation that made it competitive in a crowded market. They chose not to automate. Instead, they invested the $80K in training and cross-training the existing team. They're still operationally slower than competitors but more resilient and more cohesive.

**Case 2: A UK community land trust deciding on agricultural use**
The trust stewarded 200 acres. A developer offered to lease 40 acres for intensive monoculture (higher revenue, visible short-term gain). The land trust asked the three questions across stakeholder voices. Farmers saw: 10 minutes = relief (simplified management), 10 months = soil degradation visible, 10 years = dead land. Residents saw: 10 minutes = local revenue, 10 months = water pollution signals, 10 years = ecological collapse of shared water systems. The temporal map revealed that only the 10-minute horizon supported monoculture. They redesigned toward mixed-use: perennial crops on 30 acres, carbon sequestration on 10 acres, biodiversity corridor through the middle. Financially tighter in 10 minutes. But 10 months and 10 years showed genuine regeneration—and the diversified revenue proved more stable.

**Case 3: An activist collective's campaign choice (US-based)**
A justice organization debated whether to occupy a city council member's office to demand climate action investment. The action would generate immediate visibility (10 minutes: energized base, media coverage). At 10 months: three arrestees, legal fees, fractured relationship with sympathetic council members. At 10 years: the tactic was copied by every issue, normalizing confrontation and eroding relational trust that had built over a decade. The temporal analysis didn't kill activism—it redirected it toward longer-view pressure: they built a 18-month campaign combining voter registration, local media, and legislative drafting. The 10-year horizon showed that this approach actually shifted power structures, not just aroused them.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

AI and networked commons introduce both leverage and peril to the Ten-Ten-Ten Rule. The leverage: *distributed temporal sensing*. Machine learning can now model 10-minute sentiment, 10-month systems impact, and 10-year trajectory simultaneously across millions of data points. A commons stewarded through digital platforms can run the three-horizon analysis not as a meeting ritual but as continuous background sensing—tracking how decisions ripple through different timeframes in real time.

But the peril is severe. AI optimizes for what can be measured. The 10-year consequence (cultural coherence, trust, soil fertility) is often invisible to automated measurement. An algorithm trained to maximize the decision-framework could recommend choices that look good in the three timeframes when measured quantitatively (revenue, efficiency, output) but hollow out the unmeasured qualities (resilience, beauty, meaning) that actually sustain commons vitality. 

There's also the risk of *temporal illusion*. AI can generate highly plausible models of the 10-year future—but these are extrapolations, not actual lived consequences. A commons that trusts algorithmic modeling of long-term impact might skip the harder work of building genuine intergenerational relationships where elders carry actual lived knowledge, not predictions.

The tech context translation demands a critical practice: *interrogate what gets measured*. Before using any AI system to project 10-month and 10-year impacts, ask: What am I seeing? What am I blind to? Who benefits from this temporal model being right? A responsible implementation would combine algorithmic horizon-scanning with human testimony from people who have actually experienced the 10-year consequences of similar decisions.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

Disagreements in the commons become *temporally specific* rather than personal. When conflict surfaces, people say "I'm worried about the 10-month consequence" instead of "I don't trust you." Decisions feel robust because stakeholders can articulate what they traded and why. The commons shows signs of genuine deliberation: slowness in the right way, careful listening, visible trade-offs rather than buried resentments. Most tellingly, when the 10-month or 10-year consequence *actually arrives*, the group references the decision meeting: "This is what we said would happen. Let's adjust." Accountability becomes teachable rather than blamable.

**Signs of decay:**

The three questions become perfunctory. People answer "10 minutes: good, 10 months: okay, 10 years: fine" without genuine reflection. The temporal framework becomes cover for decisions already made by power: the dominant voice has predetermined the answer, and the rule is ritual theater. You'll notice that only certain timeframes ever raise concerns—typically the 10-minute or 10-year, while the hard 10-month consequences are repeatedly minimized or ignored. Another decay signal: the commons stops *checking*. They made the decision, answered the questions, and then never looked back to see what actually happened in 10 months. The practice becomes decoupled from reality.

**When to replant:**

If the pattern has calcified into checkbox ritual, pause it entirely for a season. Invite the community to redesign it. What timeframes actually matter for *this* commons in *this* moment? Maybe it's 10 days, 10 months, 10 years for a rapid-response mutual aid network. Or 10 hours, 10 seasons, 10 generations for land stewardship. Re-root the practice in the actual rhythms of the living system you're tending, not a generic formula. Replant when you've genuinely felt a temporal consequence and need to learn faster.
