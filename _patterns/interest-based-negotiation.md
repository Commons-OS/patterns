  Focusing on positions (what people say they want) rather than
  interests (why they want it) creates unnecessary impasse — most
  conflicts that appear zero-sum become positive-sum when underlying
  interests are surfaced. This pattern covers the Fisher & Ury
  framework: separating people from problems, focusing on interests
  not positions, generating options before evaluating, and using
  objective criteria.

When stakeholders focus on stated positions rather than underlying interests, conflicts harden into apparent zero-sum contests—but surfacing the real reasons people want what they want often reveals mutually beneficial paths forward.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Fisher & Ury / Negotiation.

---

### Section 1: Context

In any commons stewarded by multiple parties—corporate teams managing competing product roadmaps, government agencies balancing public interests, activist coalitions fighting for policy change, or product teams negotiating feature prioritization—stakeholders arrive at the table with hardened requests: "We need this budget," "We must have control over that decision," "That timeline is non-negotiable."

These positions feel urgent because they're wrapped in real fear. A product team fears resource scarcity. A department fears losing autonomy. An activist group fears their core values being compromised. When negotiators treat these stated positions as the actual problem, they design zero-sum trades: you get X, I keep Y, nobody gets everything.

The system stagnates because energy goes into defending territory rather than building shared value. Relationships fray. Trust erodes. Smaller stakeholders feel unheard. The commons loses vitality not from scarcity but from a failure to surface what would actually make each party thrive. This pattern emerges most acutely when stakes feel high, when stakes are genuinely high, or when previous negotiations have created learned distrust.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Interest vs. Negotiation.**

**Position-based negotiation** assumes scarcity is fixed. "You want Monday launch; I want Friday. We'll split Wednesday." Each side defends what they announced, making concessions feel like losses. Energy flows toward justifying your position and attacking theirs.

**Interest-based negotiation** asks: Why does Monday matter to you? Why does Friday matter to me? Often the answers are completely different. Product launch timing might matter because you're responding to competitor moves. Friday might matter because deployment staff are only available then. Those aren't in conflict—they're information that unlocks new options neither side initially saw.

The tension breaks systems in three ways:

*First,* it produces worse solutions. A Wednesday launch might serve neither party well because neither party's actual need is met.

*Second,* it burns relationships. Stakeholders remember feeling unheard, seeing their concerns dismissed as mere "positions" rather than real constraints or values.

*Third,* it trains people not to participate honestly. If stating your interest risks it being used against you, you learn to hide behind abstract positions. The commons becomes a place of theater rather than collaboration.

The pattern surfaces when genuine interdependence exists—no party can fully win alone—but stakeholders mistakenly believe they must choose between getting what they need and staying in relationship.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, create structured space to separate the people from the problem, identify the actual interests (not positions) driving each stakeholder, generate multiple options before evaluating any, and ground evaluation in objective criteria rather than power.**

This pattern shifts the root system. Instead of hardening around stated wants, stakeholders root down into what those wants serve. A budget request becomes "We need stability to hit Q3 targets" or "We're worried about being cut mid-project." A control demand becomes "We can't afford mistakes in this domain" or "We've been sidelined before."

Once interests surface, the system's real topology becomes visible. You often discover:

- **Interests that don't compete.** One party needs input; another needs autonomy in execution. Both can happen.
- **Interests that sequence rather than conflict.** One party needs momentum first; another needs permission structure first. Order them right and both thrive.
- **Shared interests masked by positional debate.** Everyone actually wants the commons to work, avoid crises, and stay solvent. Those shared interests can anchor collaboration.

The Fisher & Ury framework operates as a living discipline, not a formula. You're cultivating conditions for stakeholders to think differently about the problem itself, not just rearrange claims. This requires separating the *relational* work (treating each party as a problem-solver, not an obstacle) from the *analytical* work (mapping what each party actually needs). It requires generating options before judging them—abundance thinking instead of scarcity reflex. And it requires moving to objective criteria (data, precedent, principle) so evaluation feels fair rather than like someone won and someone lost.

When woven into commons practice, this pattern prevents the calcification that kills vitality. The system stays mobile. New stakeholders can enter because there's a method for surfacing their interests rather than a rigid positional map they must attack or defend.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**1. Prepare separately before joint negotiation.**

Meet with each stakeholder group individually. Ask: What do you actually need this decision to accomplish? Not "What do you want?" but "What problem are you trying to solve? What's at stake if you don't get this?" Document the interests in their language. This preparation prevents public posturing and gives you material to work with.

In **corporate** contexts, do this one-on-one with product, engineering, and finance leads before the planning meeting. Ask the product team: "What market threat are you responding to?" Ask engineering: "What technical debt are you protecting against?"

In **government** contexts, meet with department heads separately before the public hearing. Ask: "What service outcome do you need?" Ask the regulatory branch: "What risk are you managing?"

In **activist** contexts, convene coalition members before the strategy session. Ask each org: "What would a win look like for your constituency?" Ask the legal team: "What exposure are you managing?"

In **tech** (product teams), pull individual contributors and managers aside before the planning meeting. Ask: "What would this feature actually solve?" Ask the platform team: "What integration burden are you avoiding?"

**2. Map interests visibly; mark positions separately.**

Create two columns in the negotiation space (physical whiteboard or shared doc):

| Their Position | Their Interest |
|---|---|
| "We must have this budget" | "We can't start mid-cycle again without losing our best people" |

Do this collaboratively, not as an exercise imposed on them. Say: "Help me understand—when you say you need this, what's the real constraint or opportunity underneath?" Listen for emotion, history, fear, ambition. The interest is usually *why* they're uncomfortable, not what they're demanding.

**3. Expand the option space before evaluating.**

Once interests are clear, brainstorm solutions with everyone in the room. The key rule: generate options without evaluating them yet. No "That won't work because..." Just: "What if we..." Suggest options that serve multiple interests. Suggest options no one asked for. The goal is abundance, not efficiency.

This is where most implementations fail. Groups rush to evaluation because defending positions feels safer than exploring. Slow down. Protect the generative phase. Often the best option wasn't visible until someone named an interest and another person said, "So what if we tried..."

**4. Apply objective criteria to evaluate options.**

Move evaluation to criteria both sides can accept as fair: precedent ("We've done similar decisions this way before"), principle ("We evaluate all requests by impact-per-resource"), data ("Our historical success rates with this timeline are..."), or expert judgment ("Our security consultant says...").

This prevents the evaluation from collapsing back into power dynamics. You're not deciding based on who wants it more or who has more leverage. You're asking: Which option best serves the criteria we agree are fair?

**5. Document and circulate what you learned.**

After negotiation, write down the interests that surfaced, the options considered, and why you chose what you chose. This becomes institutional memory. Future negotiations don't start from zero. New stakeholders understand the logic, not just the decision. This is how the commons builds composability—each decision becomes a reference point.

---

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

Solutions become higher-quality because they're built on real constraints, not imagined ones. A product launch that actually serves both competitive pressure and infrastructure readiness holds better than one that just compromises. Relationships strengthen because stakeholders feel genuinely heard—not just accommodated, but understood. They see their interests reflected in the decision. Over time, people bring more of their actual thinking to the table instead of performing positions.

New stakeholders can enter the commons because there's a method for including their interests rather than a closed set of positions they must navigate. The pattern generates *institutional fluency*—people learn how to think together about hard choices. This is particularly valuable in tech and activist contexts where membership is fluid and you can't afford to retrain the same pattern every cycle.

**What risks emerge:**

The pattern can become ritualistic. Groups go through the motions—surfacing "interests" that are just positions restated, generating options no one actually considers, applying criteria that don't matter. When that happens, it feels worse than honest positional negotiation because it adds a performance layer. Watch for this especially in corporate contexts where "collaborative" language can mask continued power-based decision-making.

*Resilience scores this at 3.0*, meaning this pattern sustains existing health but doesn't necessarily build new adaptive capacity. If your commons faces unprecedented challenges—scale you've never handled, stakeholder types you've never negotiated with, speeds of change you haven't met—interest-based negotiation alone won't generate the new capabilities you need. You'll need to pair it with experimentation structures and feedback systems that let you evolve the method itself.

There's also a time cost. This pattern takes longer than command-and-control or simple majority vote. When speed matters more than buy-in, it can feel like a luxury you can't afford. The cost shows up later as implementation friction and hidden resistance.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**The Harvard Negotiation Project (1980s–present)**

Fisher, Ury, and Patton documented this pattern across labor disputes, environmental negotiations, and international diplomacy. One of their foundational examples: A dispute over whether to allow logging in a forest. The timber company's position: "We need access to this stand." Environmentalists' position: "No logging, period." Their interests: The timber company needed revenue and land access; environmentalists needed habitat protection and a precedent that old-growth forests are off-limits. The solution: The company gained access to a different watershed with better timber yields and easier logistics. The environmentalists established a protected forest precedent. Both sides got more of what they actually wanted than either would have through positional compromise.

**Product roadmap negotiation at a mid-stage SaaS company**

Three teams: Growth (position: "We need the AI features now to compete"), Infrastructure (position: "We need a rewrite quarter before we take on new scope"), and Support (position: "We need documentation and training, which neither of you is providing"). Their interests: Growth feared market share loss to a competitor; Infrastructure feared system collapse under additional load; Support feared customer churn from poor onboarding. The solution: Ship one high-impact AI feature (serving Growth's competitive interest) on the existing infrastructure *if* it was isolated as a microservice (serving Infrastructure's stability interest) *and* the team assigned a technical writer to the project from day one (serving Support's quality interest). No team got their full position, but all got what they actually needed. Implementation succeeded because each interest was woven into the design, not overridden.

**Coalition negotiation in a city housing rights campaign (activist context)**

Five organizations with positions that appeared incompatible: One wanted immediate rent control (position), one wanted community land trusts (position), one wanted tenant protections (position), one wanted developer incentives (position), one wanted displacement prevention (position). Their interests: All of them wanted tenants to stay housed and have power in their housing decisions. All feared losing the campaign to political machinery they didn't control. Their shared interest in *speed and unified voice* was actually stronger than their positional differences. They negotiated toward a platform that addressed displacement (interest shared with all) while leaving specific mechanisms flexible. The platform held because it served the actual interest—keeping people housed—rather than insisting on particular policy positions.

---

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

Interest-based negotiation assumes human judgment and interpretation are necessary. A person must listen, infer, distinguish between what someone says they want and what they actually need. In an age of AI and autonomous systems, this assumption fractures.

**New leverage:** AI can surface patterns in stated positions across many negotiations, flagging common interests faster than human facilitators. If your commons has 50 project disputes a year, an AI trained on successful and failed negotiations can suggest: "In disputes like this one, when party A expresses concern about X, they're usually protecting interest Y. Have you asked about that?" This is real acceleration. It can also reduce the relational work by pre-mapping interests before humans enter the room.

**New risks:** The pattern assumes good faith—that underneath positions, there are interests worth understanding. But in high-stakes, adversarial contexts (competitive markets, political campaigns), interests themselves might be distorted or performative. If one party's "interest" is actually to extract maximum advantage, interest-based negotiation becomes a tool they use to gather intelligence about your constraints. AI makes this more dangerous because opaque AI-driven interest analysis can mask what's really happening.

In **tech product contexts** specifically: When product priorities are negotiated via algorithms (machine learning models that weigh stakeholder requests), the interest-based framework becomes invisible. No one surfaces why a feature matters. The algorithm learns correlations but not reasons. This produces technically optimized but strategically fragile decisions—they hold until context shifts, and there's no shared understanding to adapt with.

AI also collapses the time dimension. Interest-based negotiation assumes you negotiate repeatedly with the same stakeholders, building trust that makes future conversations faster and richer. If AI makes negotiation faster but commodified, you might lose the relational accumulation that makes the pattern robust.

---

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

- Stakeholders begin proposing options, not just defending positions. ("What if we...") instead of ("You have to..."). This signals trust that the space is genuinely collaborative.
- Decisions hold across changing conditions because the reasoning is documented and the interests remain stable even when tactics shift.
- New stakeholders are incorporated quickly because there's a legible method for understanding their interests, not a hidden power map they must navigate.
- You see stakeholders checking their own positions against their interests. ("Wait, do I actually need that, or was I just reacting?") This means the framework has become internalized.

**Signs of decay:**

- The language of "interests" is used, but the pattern is still positional. Teams say "our interest is to have this budget" without exploring what the budget actually enables.
- Negotiation meetings produce options that no one finds credible because they weren't generated with real stakes in mind—they're performative.
- Stakeholders participate in interest-surfacing but don't believe it will change the outcome. Decisions feel predetermined. People stop bringing their real thinking.
- The pattern becomes a chore, a box to check before the "real" decision happens behind closed doors. Participation becomes theatrical.

**When to replant:**

Restart interest-based negotiation when you recognize that the relational trust needed to make it work has eroded—when stakeholders have learned that understanding their interests led to them being outmaneuvered. At that point, the pattern has become toxic. You need to rebuild trust before you can negotiate well. Do that through smaller, lower-stakes negotiations where interest-based methods actually produce fair outcomes, building evidence that the method serves everyone.

Redesign the pattern when your commons faces genuinely novel situations where interests themselves are unclear. Historical interest-based negotiation assumes stakeholders know roughly what they need. In rapid change, they might not. Layer in more experimentation and feedback than the traditional pattern includes.
