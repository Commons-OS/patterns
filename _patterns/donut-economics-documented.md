### 8. Commons Alignment Assessment (v2.0)

This assessment evaluates the pattern based on the Commons OS v2.0 framework, which focuses on the pattern's ability to enable resilient collective value creation.

**1. Stakeholder Architecture:**
The Donut Economics model provides a robust stakeholder architecture by explicitly defining the rights of all humans to a social foundation (e.g., health, education, equity) and the responsibility to protect the planet's ecological ceiling. This framework inherently includes the environment and future generations as key stakeholders, demanding that economic activities respect planetary boundaries to ensure long-term viability.

**2. Value Creation Capability:**
The pattern fundamentally redefines value creation beyond monetary output, focusing on the collective capability to meet the needs of all people within the means of the living planet. It champions the creation of diverse values, including social (well-being, community), ecological (biodiversity, clean air), and knowledge value, fostering a holistic and resilient economic system.

**3. Resilience & Adaptability:**
Doughnut Economics is designed for resilience and adaptability, acting as a compass for navigating complexity. By setting clear boundaries (the social foundation and ecological ceiling), it encourages continuous learning, adaptation, and systems thinking to maintain stability and coherence in the face of social and environmental stressors.

**4. Ownership Architecture:**
While not prescribing a specific ownership model, the principle of being "distributive" challenges conventional ownership structures. It advocates for sharing value with all co-creators and redistributing power, implying a shift towards more inclusive and steward-owned models that define ownership through rights and responsibilities, not just monetary equity.

**5. Design for Autonomy:**
The framework is highly compatible with autonomous systems. By providing a clear, shared goal—thriving within the Donut—it enables decentralized actors, including AI and DAOs, to self-organize and innovate. Its principles-based approach fosters low coordination overhead, as agents can align their actions with the overall objective without rigid, top-down control.

**6. Composability & Interoperability:**
Doughnut Economics is a meta-pattern designed for high composability. It acts as a "way of thinking" or a compass that can be integrated with numerous other patterns and frameworks to create context-specific solutions. Its visual and conceptual simplicity allows it to be a convening space for diverse actors to collaborate on building larger, regenerative systems.

**7. Fractal Value Creation:**
The core logic of the Donut—meeting needs within boundaries—is inherently fractal. The framework can be applied at all scales, from individuals and households to cities, nations, and the global economy. This scalability allows the value-creation logic to be replicated and adapted across different levels of social and economic organization, creating a coherent, multi-scale system.

**Overall Score: 5 (Value Creation Architecture)**

**Rationale:**
Doughnut Economics provides a complete architecture for resilient collective value creation. It reorients the goal of economics from endless growth to shared prosperity within planetary boundaries, offering a comprehensive framework for designing regenerative and distributive systems at all scales.

**Opportunities for Improvement:**
- Develop more concrete guidance on implementing distributive ownership and governance models.
- Create more tools and methodologies for applying the Donut in specific industries and contexts.
- Further explore the integration of the Donut with decentralized technologies like blockchain and AI.
