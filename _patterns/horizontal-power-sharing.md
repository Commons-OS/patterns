Build distributed authority through explicit practices that interrupt the natural tendency of power to concentrate, ensuring each participant retains capacity to shape decisions and outcomes.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Anarchist Practice.

### Section 1: Context

Power concentrates. It does so quietly, through habit. A person speaks often in meetings and becomes the default decision-maker. A team owns critical infrastructure and becomes indispensable. A role accumulates privileges and those privileges calcify into authority. This happens in movements fighting for liberation, in activist networks, in open-source collectives, in organizations and product teams trying to operate without hierarchy. The commons assessment shows this pattern scoring well on stakeholder architecture and value creation, yet moderately on resilience and ownership—the signature of a system generating good work while remaining fragile. What's missing isn't ideology. It's practice. Horizontal power-sharing fails not because the vision is wrong, but because practitioners lack concrete, repeatable mechanisms to redistribute authority before it hardens. The living ecosystem here is one where intent and reality diverge: people commit to horizontal organization, then fall back into familiar patterns under pressure, stress, or growth. This is visible in activist movements that fracture after initial victories, in corporate teams reverting to command structures when deadlines tighten, in open-source projects where "benevolent dictators" emerge unbidden. The pattern addresses this gap: not the philosophy of horizontalism, but the deliberate, disciplined practices that keep power fluid and distributed across time.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Horizontal vs. Practices.**

Horizontalism as vision is clear: no single person or group holds disproportionate authority. But horizontalism as practice is vague. The tension emerges between the aspiration for distributed power and the concrete mechanisms required to sustain it. On one side, practitioners want genuine horizontality—authentic voice for all participants, decisions shaped by those affected, no hidden hierarchy. On the other, they want the system to actually function: decisions made, work completed, capacity preserved. When the tension goes unaddressed, power concentrates anyway, often invisibly. A vocal member becomes the de facto strategist. An experienced practitioner becomes the keeper of institutional memory. Someone steps into conflict resolution and becomes the moral arbiter. The system appears horizontal while operating as pseudo-hierarchy. This breaks trust. Newcomers sense the hidden structure and withdraw. Longstanding members burn out from invisible burdens. The community fragments not from honest disagreement, but from the cognitive dissonance between stated values and lived experience. The keywords—horizontal, power sharing, practices, build, maintain—point to the real work: not declaring horizontalism, but actively building and continuously maintaining the mechanisms that keep it alive. Without deliberate practice, entropy pulls the system toward concentration.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, institutionalize specific, recurring practices that explicitly name, rotate, and redistribute the invisible work and authority that concentrates in organizations and movements.**

This pattern works by making power visible, then deliberately moving it. In living systems terms, you're preventing root disease by aerating the soil—ensuring no single root system monopolizes nutrients or water. The anarchist tradition understood this: they didn't trust individual virtue or enlightenment. They designed structures that made concentration mechanically difficult and redistribution routine.

The mechanism operates on three levels. First, *name the work*. Authority concentrates not just through formal roles, but through invisible labor: who facilitates meetings, who holds institutional memory, who arbitrates conflict, who recruits and orients newcomers. Most horizontal organizations never name these. They remain diffuse, performed by whoever steps in, usually the same person. Naming unburies the work from invisibility. Second, *rotate the work*. Once named, rotate it intentionally. Rotating facilitators, note-takers, budget-holders, agenda-setters, conflict mediators. Rotation serves multiple functions: it distributes burden, it prevents expertise from becoming gatekeeping power, it forces knowledge to spread and systems to be documented (because the next person won't know by osmosis). Rotation also teaches. Each participant learns the work's difficulty, its perspective, its constraints. This builds empathy and realistic understanding of power. Third, *create feedback loops that catch concentration*. Regular power audits—moments where the group explicitly asks: Who speaks most? Who makes final calls? Who holds information? Where are decisions actually made? Who's burning out? These audits aren't meant to shame; they're diagnostic. They catch early drift toward concentration before it hardens into habit.

The pattern draws from anarchist practice's core insight: distribute power not through trust in people's goodness, but through mechanisms that make concentration structurally costly and rotation structurally rewarding. You're building a system where concentration requires active, visible effort to maintain, while distribution is the path of least resistance.

### Section 4: Implementation

Horizontal power-sharing practices root themselves differently depending on context. In each, the principle is identical: make invisible work visible, rotate critical functions, audit regularly.

**In activist movements:** Map all non-delegated work. Host a "work mapping" session where people name every decision-making and coordination function: Who calls meetings? Who sets agendas? Who keeps the history? Who recruits? Who de-escalates conflict? Once mapped, draw explicit rotation schedules. Assign a new facilitator for each meeting cycle (monthly, quarterly). Assign agenda-setting to a different person each time. Document decisions and institutional memory in writing so knowledge isn't held in one person's head. Establish a "power check-in" every three months: a structured conversation where members name any concentration they've noticed and correct course. In the Movement for Black Lives, many chapters used "rotating spokespersons" for media—a deliberate practice to prevent any single voice from becoming the movement's face and prevent media from building power-broker relationships with specific people.

**In corporate and organizational settings:** Build role-sharing and explicit authority redistribution into performance and management systems. Instead of a single "product lead," create a rotating product lead council where the role shifts every quarter. Document all decision-making authorities—who approves budget, who defines scope, who hires—and rotate them intentionally. This requires explicit mapping in job descriptions and authority matrices, not assumption. Create "working groups" that share accountability, not individuals. At Buurtzorg, a Dutch home-care network operating horizontally across hundreds of teams, they institutionalized team rotation: facilitators, financial decision-makers, and conflict mediators rotated every 6–12 months. This kept power distributed and ensured no single person became indispensable.

**In government and public service:** Implement "lot-based selection" for certain roles. Citizens' assemblies use sortition (lottery-based selection) for participants because random selection prevents power from concentrating among volunteers or the already-credentialed. Within civil service, rotate department heads and decision-making committees. Document all decision-making processes in writing. Create citizen oversight boards that rotate membership. In participatory budgeting processes used by New York City and many other municipalities, they deliberately rotate the communities and neighborhoods involved each year so no single constituency becomes permanently empowered, and they rotate the facilitators and staff leading budget discussions.

**In tech and product contexts:** Redistribute code review authority and merging privileges. Don't let a single maintainer control what gets merged. Create a rotation where different team members hold merge authority. Institute "working agreements" that explicitly name who facilitates technical decisions, who owns roadmap authority, who handles conflict, and rotate these roles. Document architectural decisions in writing; don't hold them in one person's head. At the Debian project (a major Linux distribution), they institutionalized a rotating release manager role and decision-making through the developers' council, preventing any individual from gatekeeping.

In all contexts, measure success not by the policy's existence, but by observing: Are meetings facilitated by different people? Is institutional knowledge written down? Do people rotate through roles? Are power audits happening?

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

The system develops genuine adaptability. When power is distributed and regularly rotated, no single person's departure destabilizes the organization. Knowledge spreads; the system becomes less fragile. Trust deepens because members know authority isn't hoarded—the group has mechanisms to correct concentration. Participation increases because people see that stepping up leads to real influence, not performance of influence in a pre-set hierarchy. The organization develops deeper bench strength; more people understand how to lead, how to facilitate, how to make decisions. Communities that practice this report higher retention of committed members because the burden of carrying the work is shared.

**What risks emerge:**

Rotation can create inefficiency. A newly rotated facilitator may run meetings poorly. A rotated financial steward may make mistakes. The cost is real, not imaginary. Additionally, this pattern sustains vitality by maintaining existing health, not by generating new adaptive capacity—watch for rigidity if implementation becomes routinized. Members can perform rotations mechanically without genuinely sharing power. A person rotates into a role, but actual decisions still happen in informal channels controlled by the previous holder. The structure becomes theater. Resilience, ownership, and autonomy all score below 3.0 in the commons assessment, indicating that while this pattern distributes power, it can be fragile. If rotation isn't paired with genuine decision-making authority, people disengage. Additionally, horizontal practices can become cumbersome. More meetings to coordinate rotation, more time spent on process, less bandwidth for actual work. Groups that don't manage this boundary can atrophy under process burden. Finally, rotation without adequate documentation can scatter knowledge. A new facilitator rotates in, but no one documented the previous facilitator's tacit knowledge, so learning resets each cycle.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**The Zapatista Councils (Mexico, ongoing since 1994):** The Zapatista movement implemented "rotating government"—literally. Leadership positions rotated among members, with the explicit principle that roles would be filled by ordinary members, not specialists or "natural leaders." Councils made decisions collectively; a single person held a position for a defined term, then rotated out. This practice ensured that authority remained dispersed across the movement and that power-concentrating expertise wasn't accumulated by professional politicians. The cost was inefficiency; the gain was that the movement survived 30 years without collapsing into single-leader authoritarianism.

**Mondragon Cooperatives (Spain, since 1956):** The Mondragon network of worker cooperatives institutionalized power rotation through multiple mechanisms: the general assembly rotates voting rights, the management board includes workers who rotate positions, and top executives' salaries are capped at a multiple of the lowest wage (preventing wealth concentration). They document decision-making processes explicitly. The consequence is slower decision-making, but greater retention, lower turnover, and documented evidence that worker-owned enterprises with these practices outperform traditional corporations on stability and longevity.

**Enspiral Network (New Zealand, 2010–present):** A digital commons of roughly 500 independent practitioners, Enspiral operates through explicit rotating roles. Stewardship roles rotate annually. Decision-making happens through working groups with rotating facilitation. They've documented their governance practices extensively, creating a feedback loop: they publish decision-making processes, reflect on what concentrates power, then redesign. This transparency has made Enspiral notable for maintaining distributed power at scale—unusual and fragile, but visibly practiced.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

AI and distributed intelligence introduce new leverage and new risk to horizontal power-sharing. The leverage: algorithmic systems can now log decision patterns. AI-backed dashboards can show in real time where power is concentrating—who's approving most decisions, whose suggestions are adopted, whose voice is missing. This accelerates the "power audit" from quarterly exercise to continuous visibility, potentially making concentration mechanically detectable before it hardens. Rotation can become data-informed: "This role has concentrated decisions with this person; let's rotate." The pattern gains precision.

The risk: AI systems themselves can become gatekeepers. A machine learning model trained on past decisions becomes the de facto decision-maker. A recommendation engine suggests which team members should make certain decisions—and no one audits the model for bias. In tech contexts especially, horizontal power-sharing requires explicitly auditing AI systems for concentration: Does the model advantage certain voices? Does recommendation logic distribute decision-making or concentrate it? Practioners need to treat AI tools as potential power concentrators and audit them with the same rigor as human decision-makers.

Additionally, in cognitive era product development, Horizontal Power-Sharing Practices for Products becomes more critical and more fragile. Distributed product teams coordinating through documentation and rotation are vulnerable if AI-driven analytics become the source of truth—if a single algorithmic model determines feature priority or user value, power has concentrated invisibly. The practice requires explicit guard rails: product rotation practices that include cross-team decision-making, transparent data governance that prevents analytics monopoly, and rotation of who interprets product metrics.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

Observe who facilitates meetings. If different people are actually running meetings—not just in title, but genuinely making process decisions—the pattern is active. Look for rotating note-takers or documentation; if the same person is always writing institutional memory, power is concentrating there. Listen for who speaks in decision moments. Do different people step into opinion-shaping roles? Or does decision-making default to the same person? Check whether new members know how the group makes decisions. If institutional knowledge is written and documented, people can learn it; if held only in experienced members' heads, power is distributed through information scarcity. Finally, pay attention to retention. Groups practicing horizontal power-sharing effectively show lower burnout in leadership roles (because roles rotate) and higher commitment from newer members (because they see pathways to genuine influence).

**Signs of decay:**

The same person facilitates repeatedly, even if others are "supposed to." Decisions happen in side conversations before formal meetings. New members ask "How do things get decided here?" and get vague answers—a sign that decisions are made through invisible channels. Institutional memory lives in one person; when they're absent, the group is lost. The rotation schedule exists on paper but doesn't happen in practice. Members report feeling unable to influence direction, even if they've been present for months. High turnover of committed members who "burn out." Audits stop happening, or happen but aren't acted on—the group talks about power concentration but doesn't correct it.

**When to replant:**

Redesign this practice when it becomes ritualized without effect. If rotating facilitators has become ceremony and power remains concentrated, the rotation alone isn't enough—you need to couple it with explicit authority transfer and decision-making documentation. Restart the practice when the group has grown significantly; what worked for 15 people may not scale to 150 without redesign. Replant when membership has stabilized and you see early signs of an emerging "inner circle." That's the moment to restart the power audit and reinforce rotation.
