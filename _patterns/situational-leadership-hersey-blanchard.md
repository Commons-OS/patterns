# Situational Leadership (Hersey & Blanchard)

## 1. Overview

The Situational Leadership® Model, developed by Dr. Paul Hersey and Dr. Ken Blanchard in the late 1960s and early 1970s, is a renowned leadership framework that has had a significant and lasting impact on management and leadership development. The model's central premise is that there is no single "best" style of leadership. Instead, effective leadership is contingent upon the situation, and specifically, upon the developmental level of the individuals being led. This adaptive approach to leadership has made the model one of the most widely taught and utilized leadership frameworks in the world, with millions of leaders across various industries having been trained in its methodology [1].

The model provides a practical, actionable framework for leaders to diagnose the needs of their team members and to adapt their leadership style accordingly. It moves away from the static, one-size-fits-all leadership theories that were prevalent in the mid-20th century, and instead, emphasizes the importance of flexibility and responsiveness. By understanding the interplay between leadership style and follower development, leaders can more effectively influence and guide their teams towards achieving their goals, while also fostering individual growth and development.

## 2. Core Principles

The Situational Leadership® Model is built upon two fundamental concepts: the leadership style of the leader and the development level of the follower. The model's core principles revolve around the idea that a leader's effectiveness is determined by their ability to correctly diagnose a follower's development level and to then apply the appropriate leadership style. This dynamic and flexible approach is what distinguishes Situational Leadership® from other leadership models.

The first core principle is that leadership is not a static trait but a dynamic process. The model posits that leaders must be able to adapt their behavior to the changing needs of their followers and the evolving demands of the situation. This requires a high degree of self-awareness and the ability to consciously choose the most appropriate leadership style for a given context.

The second core principle is that follower development is a key factor in determining the appropriate leadership style. The model defines follower development in terms of two variables: competence and commitment. Competence refers to an individual's task-specific knowledge and skills, while commitment refers to their motivation and confidence. By assessing a follower's level of competence and commitment, a leader can determine their development level and tailor their leadership approach accordingly.

## 3. Key Practices

The Situational Leadership® Model outlines four distinct leadership styles and four corresponding follower development levels. The key practice of the model is for the leader to accurately diagnose the follower's development level and then apply the matching leadership style. This matching process is the cornerstone of effective situational leadership.

### Follower Development Levels

The four development levels are:

*   **D1: The Enthusiastic Beginner.** This individual is low in competence but high in commitment. They are new to a task, eager to learn, but lack the necessary skills and experience.
*   **D2: The Disillusioned Learner.** This individual has some competence but low commitment. They have started to learn the task but have become discouraged or frustrated, leading to a drop in motivation.
*   **D3: The Capable but Cautious Performer.** This individual has high competence but variable commitment. They have the skills to perform the task but may lack the confidence or motivation to do so independently.
*   **D4: The Self-Reliant Achiever.** This individual is high in both competence and commitment. They are experienced, skilled, and motivated to perform the task with little to no supervision.

### Leadership Styles

The four leadership styles are:

*   **S1: Directing (Telling).** This is a high-directive, low-supportive style. The leader provides specific instructions and closely supervises performance. This style is appropriate for D1 followers.
*   **S2: Coaching (Selling).** This is a high-directive, high-supportive style. The leader explains decisions, solicits suggestions, and praises progress. This style is appropriate for D2 followers.
*   **S3: Supporting (Participating).** This is a low-directive, high-supportive style. The leader facilitates and supports the follower's efforts towards task accomplishment and shares responsibility for decision-making. This style is appropriate for D3 followers.
*   **S4: Delegating.** This is a low-directive, low-supportive style. The leader turns over responsibility for decision-making and problem-solving to the follower. This style is appropriate for D4 followers.

## 4. Application Context

The Situational Leadership® Model is a versatile framework that can be applied in a wide range of organizational contexts, from multinational corporations to small businesses, and across various industries and sectors. Its adaptability makes it particularly useful in dynamic environments where tasks and team compositions are constantly changing. The model is not limited to the business world; it has also been successfully applied in education, the military, and non-profit organizations [2].

The model's focus on individual development makes it a valuable tool for managers and leaders who are responsible for coaching and mentoring their team members. By understanding the development level of each individual, leaders can provide the appropriate level of guidance and support to help them grow and succeed. This can lead to increased employee engagement, job satisfaction, and retention.

However, the model is not without its limitations. One of the main challenges in applying the model is the difficulty of accurately diagnosing a follower's development level. This requires a high degree of observational and analytical skill on the part of the leader. Additionally, the model's focus on individual leadership can be a drawback in team-based environments where a more collaborative approach may be more effective. Critics also point out that the model may not be universally applicable across all cultures, as leadership styles and expectations can vary significantly from one culture to another.

## 5. Implementation

Implementing the Situational Leadership® Model involves a four-step process:

1.  **Identify the specific task or goal.** The first step is to clearly define the task or goal that the follower is expected to accomplish. This provides the context for assessing the follower's development level.
2.  **Diagnose the follower's development level.** The leader then assesses the follower's competence and commitment in relation to the specific task. This involves observing the follower's performance, asking questions, and seeking feedback.
3.  **Match the leadership style to the development level.** Based on the diagnosis, the leader selects the appropriate leadership style (Directing, Coaching, Supporting, or Delegating).
4.  **Adapt the leadership style as the follower's development level changes.** The leader continuously monitors the follower's progress and adjusts their leadership style as the follower's competence and commitment evolve.

Effective implementation of the model requires ongoing training and development for leaders. Leaders need to develop the skills to accurately diagnose development levels, flexibly apply different leadership styles, and provide effective feedback and coaching. The Ken Blanchard Companies, which promotes the Situational Leadership® II model (a later version of the original model), offers a variety of training programs and resources to help leaders master the model.

## 6. Evidence & Impact

The Situational Leadership® Model has been the subject of numerous research studies over the years, with mixed results. Some studies have provided support for the model's validity and effectiveness, while others have been more critical. A 2022 study published in the *Journal of Personalized Medicine* found that a situational leadership style had a positive and significant effect on job satisfaction and employee performance [3]. Another study from 1982 provided supporting evidence for the validity of the Hersey and Blanchard model [4].

However, other researchers have raised concerns about the model's theoretical underpinnings and the lack of consistent empirical support. A 2009 article in *Leadership & Organization Development Journal* noted that without compelling empirical evidence of the validity of SLT's principles, it is difficult to endorse the use of the model in leadership training programs [5].

Despite the mixed research findings, the Situational Leadership® Model has had a significant impact on the field of leadership development. It is one of the most widely recognized and utilized leadership frameworks in the world, and it has helped to popularize the idea that effective leadership is about adapting to the situation. The model's emphasis on follower development has also had a positive influence on management practices, encouraging leaders to take a more active role in coaching and mentoring their team members.

## 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

In the Cognitive Era, characterized by the increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence, automation, and data-driven decision-making, the Situational Leadership® Model remains relevant, but its application needs to be adapted to the new realities of the workplace. The rise of remote work and distributed teams, for example, requires leaders to be more intentional and explicit in their communication and to find new ways to build relationships and foster a sense of team cohesion.

The increasing complexity and ambiguity of work in the Cognitive Era also place a greater premium on adaptability and learning agility. Leaders who are able to quickly diagnose changing situations and adapt their leadership style accordingly will be more effective in this new environment. The Situational Leadership® Model provides a useful framework for developing this kind of adaptability.

Furthermore, the growing importance of knowledge work and the need for continuous innovation require a leadership approach that empowers and enables employees. The higher-level leadership styles in the Situational Leadership® Model (Supporting and Delegating) are well-suited to this new reality, as they emphasize autonomy, trust, and shared responsibility.

## 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

The Commons Alignment Assessment evaluates how well the Situational Leadership® Model aligns with the principles of a commons-based approach to organizing and creating value. The assessment is based on seven dimensions, each rated on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 represents low alignment and 5 represents high alignment.

| Dimension                  | Score | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | :---: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Openness & Transparency**  |   3   | The model itself is open and transparent, but its application can vary. While the leader is encouraged to be open with the follower about their development level and the leadership style being used, this is not always the case in practice.                                                              |
| **Decentralization & Polycentricity** |   2   | The model is inherently hierarchical, with the leader making the final decision about the appropriate leadership style. While the higher-level styles (Supporting and Delegating) involve more decentralization of decision-making, the model is still leader-centric.                                     |
| **Community & Trust**      |   4   | The model emphasizes the importance of the relationship between the leader and the follower, and it encourages leaders to build trust by being supportive and responsive to the follower's needs. This can help to foster a strong sense of community within a team.                                     |
| **Collaboration & Co-creation** |   3   | The model encourages collaboration, particularly in the Supporting and Delegating styles, where the leader and follower work together to achieve goals. However, the model is more focused on individual development than on collective co-creation.                                                              |
| **Fairness & Equity**      |   3   | The model promotes fairness in the sense that it encourages leaders to treat each follower as an individual and to provide them with the level of support they need to succeed. However, the subjective nature of the development level assessment can lead to bias and inequity.                  |
| **Sustainability & Resilience** |   3   | The model can contribute to the sustainability and resilience of an organization by fostering the development of its members. By helping followers to become more competent and committed, the model can create a more capable and adaptable workforce.                                                |
| **Purpose & Contribution** |   4   | The model can help to align individual purpose with organizational goals by providing a framework for meaningful work and personal growth. By empowering followers and giving them the opportunity to take on more responsibility, the model can help them to feel a greater sense of purpose and contribution. |

**Overall Commons Alignment Score: 3**
