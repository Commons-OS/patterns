# Information Diet Design

Curate your information intake—news, social media, podcasts, books—as deliberately as you curate your food diet.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Clay Johnson / Information Ecology.

---

## Section 1: Context

Professional and civic life now runs on information flows that dwarf our ancestors' entire lifetime consumption. A career professional navigates fragmented news ecosystems, algorithmic feeds optimised for engagement rather than nourishment, streaming platforms stacked with infinite content, and peer networks amplified by social media. The commons of shared understanding—once stewarded by editors, institutions, or gatekeepers—has fragmented into thousands of micro-ecosystems, each with its own incentive structure and truth claims.

The system is actively fragmenting. Knowledge workers report higher rates of decision paralysis, cognitive fatigue, and reduced capacity to hold nuance. Organisations leak institutional memory as information sprawls across Slack channels, email threads, and forgotten wikis. Activists find themselves doomscrolling instead of organising. Government agencies struggle to form coherent policy when their teams consume incompatible information streams.

Yet attention is finite. The human nervous system evolved to process roughly 10–15 hours of focused information per day; we now encounter that volume before lunch. The tension between our need to stay informed and our actual processing capacity creates a system in slow decay—where we consume more but understand less, share more but trust less. Information Diet Design emerges when practitioners recognise that *what we attend to shapes what we become*, and that attending requires design.

---

## Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Information vs. Design.**

On one side: **Information**—the gravitational pull toward completeness, toward knowing everything, toward capturing every signal. News cycles reward constant checking. Social algorithms reward novelty-seeking. Professional culture equates busyness with importance, and information consumption masquerades as productivity. The fear of missing out is real and organisationally reinforced.

On the other side: **Design**—the need to be intentional, to say no, to create constraints that allow deep work and genuine understanding. Design requires boundaries: time, sources, formats that demand active engagement rather than passive scrolling. Design means making choices that feel scarcity in a world of abundance.

When unresolved: practitioners become information-saturated but undernourished. They feel simultaneously over-informed and under-understanding. Decision quality declines because the signal-to-noise ratio collapses. In organisations, this manifests as endless meetings about problems nobody has time to think through. In activism, it becomes performance—sharing outrage without organising action. Relationships fray because presence is fractured across a dozen feeds. Cognitive resilience erodes under constant low-grade stress.

The problem is not information itself. The problem is **the absence of curation**—the failure to ask: *What information serves the goals and values of this person, team, or system?* Without curation, we become passive recipients of whatever the algorithm or the news cycle serves. Information diet design reframes this: not as deprivation, but as sovereignty. What we choose to attend to is among our most consequential decisions.

---

## Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, audit your current information intake, design a deliberate menu of sources aligned to your real goals, enforce hard boundaries on consumption time and formats, and review the diet monthly to prune what no longer nourishes.**

Information Diet Design works by shifting from *accidental consumption* to *intentional cultivation*. Think of it as the difference between eating whatever's in the pantry versus growing a garden.

The mechanism operates at three levels:

**Roots (Inventory & Intention).** First, map what you're actually consuming—not what you *think* you consume. A week of honest tracking usually reveals the gap. Then ask: *Which sources are feeding real work or understanding? Which are feeding anxiety, envy, or habit?* Anchor this to specific goals. A career-development professional needs different sources than a policy maker or an activist. The audit creates awareness; the intention creates coherence.

**Growth (Composition & Format).** Source quality matters more than source quantity. Clay Johnson's Information Ecology principle holds that the *format itself shapes cognition*. A well-edited book builds different neural patterns than algorithmic feeds. A curated newsletter (human-filtered) offers better signal-to-noise than a firehose of notifications. This pattern encourages moving from passive, infinite formats (feeds, streams, recommendations) toward active, bounded formats (books, selected newsletters, scheduled podcasts, intentional conversations). The format itself becomes a boundary mechanism.

**Renewal (Rhythm & Review).** A diet without periodic review calcifies. Monthly audit: *What sources have stopped serving? What new signals matter? Where have I drifted into passive consumption again?* This prevents the pattern from becoming rigid dogma. It keeps the system alive to changing needs.

The shift from Information (pull toward everything) to Design (intentional curation) releases cognitive and emotional capacity. You stop defending the impossibility of staying fully informed and start defending the feasibility of staying *adequately informed* about *what matters*. This reframes busyness as a choice, not a condition. That reframe is where autonomy returns.

---

## Section 4: Implementation

**Corporate (Information Management Strategy):**
Conduct a team-level information audit. Map the sources each role actually depends on: which systems, reports, news feeds, and conversations drive decisions? Identify the redundant ones (multiple sources saying the same thing) and the parasitic ones (creating urgency without signal). Design a shared **Source Menu**—a curated list by role and goal. Finance needs different sources than Product, but both should have explicit boundaries. Set a Monday morning ritual: 30 minutes maximum on email and news. Declare slack channels off-limits during focus hours. Quarterly, measure decision quality against information diet: *Are we making faster, better calls?* If not, you're still consuming noise.

**Government (Media Literacy Policy):**
Build information diet design into civil service onboarding and leadership development. Create agency-level **Information Standards** that specify: which sources inform policy decisions? How do we validate competing claims? Establish a rotation where analysts spend time outside their echo chamber—environmental staff read business press; defence staff read independent journalism. Fund a **Civic Information Cooperative** that curates verified sources for government staff and the public. Model the practice at the top: publish your own information diet as a leader. Transparency here builds legitimacy.

**Activist (Informed Activism):**
Replace doomscroll culture with intentional study. Create a **Weekly Study Grid**: Monday reads a long-form investigative piece; Wednesday a policy document or zine from your community; Friday a strategic conversation with an organiser. This takes 3–4 hours but delivers signal instead of reactive outrage. Design your social media engagement: post once daily for 15 minutes. Mute keywords that trigger doom spirals. Join or form a **Reading Cohort**—6–8 activists who read the same text and gather to discuss, forcing deeper engagement than solo consumption. Measure impact by campaigns launched and relationships deepened, not by shares or followers.

**Tech (Information Diet AI Curator):**
Build information diet design into your product or platform. Create a **User Audit Tool** that lets people see their actual consumption patterns: time spent, source distribution, emotional valence of content. Offer a **Curated Feed Mode** alongside algorithmic feed—sources selected by domain experts or communities, not by engagement metrics. Develop **Friction UI**—designs that make infinite scroll require deliberate action (click to see more; timer before autoplay). Implement **Consumption Analytics**: show users their own information diet the way fitness apps show nutrition. Partner with schools and newsrooms to open-source these tools. The leverage point is transparency—when people see their consumption patterns clearly, design becomes possible.

---

## Section 5: Consequences

**What Flourishes:**

Cognitive capacity returns. Practitioners report clearer thinking, faster decision-making, and reduced ambient anxiety. The nervous system gets recovery time. Deep work becomes possible when shallow interruption is designed out.

Relationships strengthen. Presence returns. People can actually listen to each other instead of half-attending while monitoring feeds. Teams develop shared information contexts—they're reading similar sources, so conversations build on common ground rather than fragmenting across incompatible knowledge bases.

Organisational or movement culture shifts. Busyness stops being a status marker and becomes a sign of poor design. Knowledge work becomes visible: what are you actually *learning* versus what are you just reacting to?

**What Risks Emerge:**

**Rigidity.** This pattern can calcify into dogma—a fixed list of "good" sources and "bad" ones. The vitality reasoning flagged this: information diet design sustains existing health but doesn't always generate new adaptive capacity. If you stop auditing, you can miss emerging signals. A curated list from 2020 may miss climate science breakthroughs in 2024.

**Fragmentation.** Without shared source agreement, teams can drift further apart. If different people curate entirely different diets, you lose common reference. Implementation must balance personal autonomy with some organisational coherence.

**False Confidence.** A clean information diet creates a false sense of completeness. You may feel *more* informed while actually being *less* exposed to dissent or alternative frames. This is the converse of doomscroll: curated complacency. Resilience score (3.0) is moderate because this pattern needs regular testing against reality.

---

## Section 6: Known Uses

**Clay Johnson's "The Information Diet" (2012–present).** Johnson, a technologist and civic innovator, documented his own three-month experiment with information diet design: unsubscribing from all news feeds, selecting only books and conversations, then carefully reintroducing sources. His finding: reading *one* editorial newspaper fully (engaged reading) beat skimming twenty sources. He tracked his own anxiety levels and decision quality. The pattern spread through tech organisations and journalism schools. Johnson later formalised this as **Information Ecology**—the study of how information systems shape cognition and behaviour. Many newsrooms now teach information diet design to audiences as part of media literacy.

**The Guardian's "News Diet" Project (2018–2020).** Journalists at the UK newspaper ran an experiment with readers: half continued normal news consumption; half followed a designed news diet (30 minutes daily, three sources, one analysis piece weekly). Six months later, the diet group reported higher understanding of complex stories, lower anxiety, and better retention. Notably, they *didn't consume less*—they consumed more strategically. This led to The Guardian's explicit "slow news" initiative, which repositioned reading as a designed practice, not a reactive habit. The pattern showed up in corporate strategy: how do we build loyalty through *quality of attention* rather than quantity of clicks?

**Midwest Academy Organising Training (ongoing).** The Midwest Academy, a training institution for U.S. activists, embedded information diet design into their core curriculum in 2015. Organisers train in **Study Weeks**: structured time to read analysis, policy documents, and movement history alongside weekly strategy sessions. The pattern emerged after noticing that activist burnout correlated with endless social media monitoring without commensurate political deepening. Cohorts now allocate 4 hours per week to *studied learning* and cap social media at 30 minutes. Impact: measurable increase in campaign sophistication and volunteer retention. The pattern scaled to multiple movement networks.

---

## Section 7: Cognitive Era

AI fundamentally reshapes Information Diet Design in three ways:

**First: Personalization Becomes Seductive Risk.** AI curators can now tailor information diets with unprecedented precision—what *you* will find engaging, *your* learning style, *your* goals. This seems like a gift but creates a new trap: hyper-personalisation can make echo chambers invisible. An AI curator that optimises purely for your stated goals may quietly filter out dissent or discomfort. The implementation risk is **algorithmic capture**—the system becomes so frictionless that auditing becomes invisible. The antidote: demand **explainability**. Your information diet AI should show you *why* sources were chosen and what's being filtered out. Make the curation visible.

**Second: Collaborative Curation Becomes Possible.** AI can mediate **shared diet design** across teams or communities. Imagine a system where activists, organisers, and analysts collectively design information sources for a campaign—human judgment choosing topics, AI handling the sorting and deduplication. This could scale the Information Ecology principle from individual practice to collective practice. The leverage is real: a team with a shared, AI-assisted information diet can move faster and with higher coherence.

**Third: New Failure Modes Emerge.** An AI curator trained on "engagement" metrics will still optimise for clicks even if you ask for signal. A curator trained on "alignment with your views" becomes a propaganda tool. The tech context translation (Information Diet AI Curator) is significant: whoever controls the training data and optimisation function controls what constitutes a "good" diet. This shifts power. The pattern's resilience (3.0) becomes critical here. You need regular, human-controlled audits of what the AI is actually serving, not just what it *claims* to serve.

The cognitive era makes Information Diet Design simultaneously more necessary and more fraught. The need for intentional curation intensifies; the tools that could automate it are themselves vectors for capture. The pattern must evolve: design should include **AI oversight mechanisms**—regular human audits of algorithmic choices, transparent source disclosure, and control over the optimisation function itself.

## Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of Life:**

- **Clarity in decision-making.** Practitioners report faster, more confident decisions after 4–8 weeks. The signal-to-noise ratio is visible; they know which sources informed what choice. Ask team members: *Can you name the three sources that shaped your last major decision?* If yes, the diet is working.

- **Presence returns.** Meetings have different quality. People listen without simultaneously monitoring feeds. Relationships deepen. Anxiety about "staying informed" noticeably drops. Team members report fewer late-night scrolling sessions.

- **Source conversation becomes explicit.** Instead of private consumption, sources become shared. People say *"I read this in X and it's relevant to our work."* Collective intelligence emerges from common reference points. The team knows what information shaped thinking.

- **Routine review happens.** Practitioners actively audit their diet monthly. New sources get added; old ones get pruned. The practice feels alive, not rote.

**Signs of Decay:**

- **It becomes invisible.** The diet hardens into a fixed list. No auditing happens. New team members inherit the list without question. Sources that no longer serve stay because "that's what we use." The pattern has calcified.

- **It generates smugness.** Practitioners feel superior to "information-saturated" peers instead of genuinely curious. Curation becomes identity marker rather than practice. This is a sign the pattern has lost vitality—it's performing righteousness, not enabling understanding.

- **Shared gaps emerge.** Different teams curate entirely different diets with zero overlap. Cross-functional work breaks down because people operate from incompatible information bases. The pattern has fragmented the commons instead of stewarding it.

- **Anxiety returns.** Practitioners feel FOMO despite the diet. They're checking "off-diet" sources during stress. The boundary is performative, not genuinely protecting focus. The underlying problem—the fear of missing out—hasn't been addressed, only suppressed.

**When to Replant:**

Restart or redesign the practice when you notice the audit has stopped or when new team members inherit the diet without understanding *why* the sources matter. The pattern needs replanting when the system has shifted: a new strategic goal, a team restructure, or emerging information sources that are clearly relevant but missing. The right moment is quarterly—build regular replanting into the rhythm instead of waiting for decay to force redesign. If you're not reviewing the diet, you're not practising Information Diet Design; you're managing an outdated list.
