### 1. Overview

Platform Enshittification is a critical anti-pattern that describes the predictable, cyclical degradation of quality on online platforms. Coined by author and activist Cory Doctorow, the term captures the process whereby a platform, once beneficial and attractive to its users, gradually shifts its focus towards extracting value for its shareholders at the expense of the user experience, and ultimately, the platform's own long-term viability. This process is not a random decline but a deliberate, multi-stage strategy driven by the logic of platform capitalism. It represents a fundamental betrayal of the initial promise made to users and business customers, a shift from a symbiotic relationship to a parasitic one. The pattern is a powerful lens through which to understand the life cycle of many of the dominant digital platforms that shape our lives, from social media and e-commerce to the gig economy.

The significance of this pattern lies in its ability to demystify the seemingly inexplicable decline of beloved online services. It provides a framework for recognizing the warning signs of a platform's decay and for understanding the economic incentives that drive this process. For users, it explains why their feeds become cluttered with ads and irrelevant content, why search results become less useful, and why the services they rely on seem to become actively hostile to their interests. For businesses, it explains why the platforms that once offered a direct line to customers become expensive and ineffective marketing channels. By understanding enshittification, we can move beyond simply complaining about the state of the internet and begin to identify the systemic forces at play. This understanding is the first step towards imagining and building more equitable and sustainable digital ecosystems.

The historical context of enshittification is rooted in the rise of the platform economy and the dominance of a few large technology companies. The term itself was coined by Cory Doctorow in a 2023 blog post, but the phenomenon it describes has been observable for much longer. Early internet pioneers envisioned a decentralized and democratic digital commons, but the commercialization of the web in the late 1990s and early 2000s set the stage for the rise of walled gardens and data-driven business models. The dot-com bubble and its aftermath led to a focus on profitability and shareholder value, creating the conditions for the emergence of platforms that prioritized growth at all costs. The subsequent consolidation of the tech industry, with a handful of companies achieving near-monopolistic control over key sectors, has exacerbated the problem, making it difficult for users and businesses to escape the clutches of enshittified platforms.

### 2. Core Principles

1.  **The Three-Phase Cycle of Decay:** Enshittification unfolds in a predictable three-stage process. First, the platform is good to its users, offering a valuable service for free or at a low cost to attract a large user base. Second, the platform turns on its users and becomes good to its business customers, offering them access to the user base for a fee. Finally, the platform turns on its business customers and extracts all the value for itself, squeezing both users and businesses to maximize profits for its shareholders. This cycle is the defining characteristic of the enshittification pattern.

2.  **The Primacy of Shareholder Value:** The driving force behind enshittification is the relentless pressure to maximize shareholder value. Publicly traded platform companies are legally obligated to prioritize the financial interests of their shareholders above all else. This creates a powerful incentive to engage in extractive practices, even if they harm users and undermine the long-term health of the platform. The pursuit of short-term profits often leads to decisions that are detrimental to the user experience and the overall quality of the service.

3.  **The Power of Network Effects and Lock-In:** Enshittification is made possible by the powerful forces of network effects and user lock-in. As a platform grows, it becomes more valuable to each user, creating a virtuous cycle of growth. This makes it difficult for users to leave, even when the platform starts to degrade. The high switching costs, both in terms of data portability and social connections, create a captive audience that can be exploited for profit. This lock-in effect is a key enabler of the enshittification process.

4.  **The Erosion of Trust and Transparency:** A key symptom of enshittification is the erosion of trust and transparency. Platforms that were once open and communicative become opaque and manipulative. Algorithmic feeds replace chronological timelines, making it difficult for users to control what they see. Shadowbanning and other forms of content moderation are often applied inconsistently and without explanation. This lack of transparency creates a sense of powerlessness and frustration among users, further degrading the user experience.

5.  **The Illusion of Choice and Competition:** While the market may appear to offer a variety of platforms, the reality is often one of limited choice and competition. The dominance of a few large players, coupled with the power of network effects, makes it difficult for new entrants to challenge the incumbents. This lack of meaningful competition allows enshittified platforms to continue their extractive practices without fear of losing their user base. The illusion of choice masks the underlying reality of a monopolistic or oligopolistic market structure.

6.  **The Externalization of Costs:** Enshittified platforms often externalize the costs of their operations onto society as a whole. This can take many forms, from the spread of misinformation and hate speech to the exploitation of gig economy workers. The platforms themselves are often not held accountable for these negative externalities, as they are able to operate in a regulatory gray area. This allows them to profit from harmful activities while avoiding the associated costs.

7.  **The Inevitability of Decay (in a Closed System):** In a closed system, where there is no meaningful competition or regulation, enshittification can be seen as an almost inevitable outcome. The internal logic of platform capitalism, with its focus on growth and profit maximization, naturally leads to the degradation of quality over time. Without external pressures to act in the public interest, platforms will continue to prioritize their own financial interests at the expense of their users and society as a whole.

### 3. Key Practices

1.  **Bait-and-Switch User Acquisition:** The first practice of enshittification is to attract a large user base by offering a valuable service for free or at a very low cost. This "bait" is designed to create a strong network effect and lock users into the platform. Once a critical mass of users has been reached, the platform can then begin to "switch" its focus to monetization, often at the expense of the user experience.

2.  **Algorithmic Obfuscation and Manipulation:** Enshittified platforms often replace transparent, user-controlled feeds with opaque, algorithmic ones. This allows the platform to manipulate what users see, prioritizing content that is more likely to generate engagement and ad revenue, rather than content that is most relevant or useful to the user. This practice is a key tool for extracting value from the user base.

3.  **The Introduction of "Pay-to-Play" Mechanics:** As a platform matures, it often introduces "pay-to-play" mechanics that force businesses to pay for visibility. This can take the form of boosted posts, sponsored content, or preferential placement in search results. This practice turns the platform into a tollbooth, where businesses must pay to reach the audience they once had for free.

4.  **The Gradual Degradation of Core Features:** In the pursuit of profit, enshittified platforms often neglect or even degrade their core features. This can include everything from the quality of search results to the reliability of messaging services. The focus shifts from providing a good user experience to finding new ways to monetize the platform, even if it means making the service worse.

5.  **The Exploitation of User Data:** Enshittified platforms are masters of data extraction. They collect vast amounts of data on their users, which they then use to target advertising and personalize content. This data is often collected without the user's full knowledge or consent, and it is used to manipulate their behavior for profit.

6.  **The Suppression of Dissent and Competition:** Enshittified platforms often use their power to suppress dissent and competition. This can include everything from shadowbanning users who are critical of the platform to acquiring and shutting down potential competitors. This practice helps to maintain the platform's dominant market position and prevent users from leaving.

7.  **The Abdication of Responsibility:** A final practice of enshittification is the abdication of responsibility for the negative consequences of the platform's operations. This can include everything from the spread of misinformation and hate speech to the exploitation of workers. The platform will often claim to be a neutral intermediary, while at the same time profiting from the harmful activities that take place on its service.

### 4. Application Context

**Best Used For:**

*   Analyzing the business models of large technology platforms.
*   Understanding the decline in quality of online services.
*   Identifying the warning signs of a platform's decay.
*   Developing strategies for resisting enshittification.

**Not Suitable For:**

*   Platforms that are not driven by a profit motive.
*   Open-source and community-governed platforms.
*   Platforms that operate in a highly competitive market.

**Scale:**

Platform enshittification is a phenomenon that can occur at any scale, from small niche platforms to the largest global technology giants. However, it is most pronounced in markets that are dominated by a few large players, where the forces of network effects and user lock-in are strongest. The scale of the platform can also affect the speed at which enshittification occurs. Larger platforms may be able to sustain a period of user-centric growth for longer, but the underlying economic incentives remain the same.

**Domains:**

*   Social Media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter/X, TikTok)
*   E-commerce (e.g., Amazon)
*   Search (e.g., Google)
*   Gig Economy (e.g., Uber, DoorDash)
*   Creative Industries (e.g., YouTube, Spotify)
*   Academic Publishing

### 5. Implementation

As an anti-pattern, "implementation" refers to the process by which a platform becomes enshittified. This is not a conscious decision to build a bad product, but rather a series of small, incremental choices that, over time, lead to a significant degradation of quality. The implementation of enshittification is a gradual process, often imperceptible to users in its early stages. It begins with a focus on growth at all costs, with the platform offering a generous and often unsustainable level of service to attract users. This initial phase is characterized by a sense of excitement and possibility, as the platform appears to be a genuine innovation that is improving people's lives.

Once the platform has achieved a critical mass of users, the implementation of enshittification enters its second phase. The focus shifts from user acquisition to monetization, and the platform begins to introduce changes that are designed to extract value from its user base. This can include the introduction of advertising, the promotion of sponsored content, and the collection of user data for targeted marketing. These changes are often framed as necessary for the long-term sustainability of the platform, but they represent a fundamental shift in the relationship between the platform and its users.

The final phase of the implementation of enshittification is the most destructive. The platform, now a dominant force in its market, turns on its business customers and begins to extract value from them as well. This can include raising advertising rates, charging for access to the platform's API, and competing directly with the businesses that rely on the platform. At this stage, the platform has become a fully extractive enterprise, with little regard for the interests of its users or its business customers. The implementation of enshittification is complete, and the platform has become a hollowed-out shell of its former self.

The implementation of enshittification is not inevitable, but it is a powerful and seductive path for platform companies to follow. The promise of short-term profits and shareholder value can be difficult to resist, especially in a market that is characterized by intense competition and a lack of regulation. However, by understanding the process of enshittification, we can begin to identify the warning signs and take steps to resist it. This can include supporting alternative platforms, advocating for stronger regulation, and demanding greater transparency and accountability from the platforms that we use every day.

### 6. Evidence & Impact

The evidence for platform enshittification is all around us. We see it in the decline of Facebook from a vibrant social network to a cluttered and manipulative advertising platform. We see it in the transformation of Google from a simple and effective search engine to a complex and ad-driven ecosystem. We see it in the rise and fall of countless other platforms that have followed the same predictable trajectory of decay. The impact of enshittification is profound, affecting not only our online lives but also our offline world. It has contributed to the spread of misinformation and hate speech, the erosion of privacy, and the exploitation of workers.

One of the most well-documented examples of enshittification is the case of Facebook. In its early days, Facebook was a simple and elegant platform for connecting with friends and family. It was free to use, and it was not cluttered with ads. However, as the platform grew, it began to introduce changes that were designed to monetize its user base. The News Feed was introduced, which replaced the chronological timeline with an algorithmic one. This allowed Facebook to control what users saw, and to prioritize content that was more likely to generate engagement and ad revenue. The platform also began to collect vast amounts of data on its users, which it used to target advertising with unprecedented precision. These changes, while profitable for Facebook, have had a devastating impact on the user experience and on society as a whole.

The impact of enshittification is not limited to social media. The gig economy is another area where the pattern is clearly visible. Platforms like Uber and DoorDash initially offered attractive terms to both drivers and customers, but as they have grown, they have begun to squeeze both sides of the market. Drivers have seen their wages stagnate or decline, while customers have seen prices rise and service quality decline. The platforms themselves have become increasingly powerful, with little accountability to their workers or their customers. The enshittification of the gig economy is a stark reminder of the human cost of platform capitalism. Amazon is another prime example of enshittification. The platform initially attracted customers with low prices and a vast selection of products. However, as it has grown, it has become increasingly difficult for customers to find what they are looking for. The search results are often cluttered with sponsored products and low-quality items from third-party sellers. The platform has also been accused of using its market power to squeeze its suppliers and exploit its warehouse workers. The enshittification of Amazon has transformed it from a convenient and reliable retailer into a frustrating and often overwhelming marketplace.

### 7. Anti-Patterns & Gotchas

The rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning is likely to accelerate the process of enshittification. AI-powered algorithms can be used to create even more personalized and manipulative user experiences, further eroding user autonomy and control. The use of AI in content moderation can also lead to new forms of censorship and suppression of dissent. As AI becomes more sophisticated, it will become increasingly difficult for users to distinguish between authentic and inauthentic content, making them even more vulnerable to manipulation. For example, generative AI could be used to create fake reviews and other forms of deceptive content, further degrading the quality of online information. The use of AI to automate customer service can also lead to a decline in the quality of support, as users are forced to interact with chatbots that are unable to understand their problems or provide meaningful assistance.

The cognitive era also presents new opportunities for resisting enshittification. AI can be used to create more transparent and accountable algorithms, and to empower users with more control over their data. The development of decentralized and community-governed AI systems could also provide an alternative to the centralized and corporate-controlled platforms that dominate the current landscape. For example, AI-powered tools could be used to help users identify and filter out manipulative content, or to find and support alternative platforms that are more aligned with their values. The future of the internet will depend on our ability to harness the power of AI for good, and to build a more equitable and sustainable digital world. This will require a concerted effort from researchers, developers, policymakers, and citizens to ensure that AI is used to empower individuals and communities, rather than to enrich a small number of powerful corporations.

### 8. References

-   **Shared Resource Potential:** Low - Platform enshittification is fundamentally about the enclosure and privatization of a shared resource (the platform and its user base). It takes a resource that was once open and accessible and turns it into a private asset to be exploited for profit. The value that is created by the community is not shared with the community, but is instead captured by the platform owner.

-   **Democratic Governance:** Low - Enshittified platforms are characterized by a complete lack of democratic governance. Decisions are made by a small group of executives and shareholders, with no input from the users or the community. This lack of accountability is a key enabler of the enshittification process. Users have no say in how the platform is run, and they have no recourse when the platform makes decisions that are harmful to their interests.

-   **Equitable Access:** Low - While enshittified platforms may offer free or low-cost access to their services, this access is often contingent on the user's willingness to be tracked, monitored, and manipulated. The platform is not a level playing field, but a carefully controlled environment that is designed to benefit the platform owner at the expense of the user. Users who are not willing to submit to the platform's terms of service are often excluded from the platform, or are forced to use a degraded version of the service.

-   **Sustainability:** Low - The business model of enshittified platforms is not sustainable in the long term. The relentless pursuit of short-term profits leads to the degradation of the platform and the erosion of user trust. This ultimately undermines the platform's own viability, leading to a cycle of boom and bust. The platform may be able to generate large profits in the short term, but it does so at the expense of its long-term health and the well-being of its users.

-   **Community Benefit:** Low - Enshittified platforms are not designed to benefit the community. They are designed to extract value from the community and transfer it to a small group of shareholders. The negative externalities of enshittification, such as the spread of misinformation and the exploitation of workers, far outweigh any potential benefits to the community. The platform may provide some value to its users, but this value is often outweighed by the harm that it causes.
