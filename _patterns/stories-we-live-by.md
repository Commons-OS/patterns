We continually tell ourselves stories about who we are and what is possible; these narratives become self-fulfilling.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Narrative therapy.

---

### Section 1: Context

In intrapreneurship—the work of launching ventures within existing structures—practitioners inhabit a peculiar ecosystem. They inherit organizational stories: "we're not an innovation company," "our culture doesn't tolerate risk," "we've tried this before and failed." These narratives live in the body of the institution, shaping what gets funded, who gets listened to, which experiments are permitted. Meanwhile, individuals carry personal stories too: "I'm not creative enough," "people like me don't lead here," "this won't work because of how things are." 

The commons arises precisely here—in the gap between inherited narrative and lived possibility. When a team recognizes they are *telling themselves* stories rather than merely *living in* reality, something cracks open. The organization that has said "we are bureaucratic" for twenty years discovers it can narrate differently. The intrapreneurs who believed "change happens to us" begin authoring change themselves. 

This pattern is most vital when the system is fragmenting—when old stories no longer fit new conditions, when silos have calcified narratives into separate realities, when people feel trapped not by actual constraints but by unexamined assumptions. The commons creates a container where members can surface these narratives together, examine their roots, and deliberately compose new ones rooted in actual capacity and shared intention.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is The vs. By.**

The tension surfaces as a choice between two modes of narrative relationship:

**The** (passive, inherited): We live *by* stories told *to us*. The organization has a story; we conform to it. The culture is what it is. The market demands this. The constraints are fixed. In this mode, narratives feel like weather—inevitable, external, not ours to change. People organize their behavior around "the way things are here," and that shape hardens.

**By** (active, authored): We live *by* stories we tell *ourselves*, deliberately. The commons creates space for collective re-authoring. We examine what we've been saying and choose what to say next. We compose narratives that reflect our actual values and emerging capacity.

When the tension goes unresolved, two breakdowns occur. First, the system grows rigid: narratives ossify into dogma. People feel trapped by stories they never consciously chose, and the organization loses adaptive capacity because no one believes change is within reach. Second, narratives become fragmented: different silos tell contradictory stories about who they are and what's possible, creating friction and waste at every boundary.

The real cost is vitality. A team that believes "we are slow to innovate" will unconsciously slow down. An organization that says "failure is unacceptable" will hide failures rather than learn from them. A commons that doesn't attend to narrative will inherit limiting stories and pass them forward without examination, each generation believing them more firmly.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, establish regular narrative inquiry sessions where members surface, externalize, and deliberately revise the stories that shape collective behavior and individual possibility.**

The mechanism is deceptively simple but requires skill to tend well. Narrative therapy teaches that the problem is not the person—it's the story the person has internalized about themselves. This pattern inverts that slightly: the problem is not the organization. It's the story the organization (and its members) has internalized about what it is and what it can do.

When members gather to *name* the stories they've been living by, three shifts happen in sequence:

**Externalization**: Stories move from invisible background to visible foreground. Instead of "we are a hierarchical organization that can't move fast," the group says aloud: "We tell ourselves a story that we are hierarchical and therefore slow." The moment you can name the story, you separate yourself from it. You are no longer *it*; you are the one *telling* it. This small grammatical shift opens agency.

**Examination**: Once externalized, the story becomes examinable. The group asks: Where did this story come from? What evidence supports it? What evidence contradicts it? What does this story let us do? What does it prevent us from doing? Does this story still serve us? Roots become visible. Often, stories were authored in response to real conditions that no longer exist—a failed product launch five years ago, a leader who departed, a market shift. The story persists long after the conditions that birthed it have changed.

**Re-authoring**: The commons then composes new narratives explicitly. Not through wishful thinking—through grounded observation of actual capacity. "We moved this decision 40% faster last quarter. What did we do differently?" The new story roots in observed reality, not aspiration alone. It becomes self-fulfilling because it's already beginning to be true.

The living systems insight: narratives are like root systems. They stay mostly invisible but shape everything above ground. When you tend the roots—making stories explicit, examining them, planting new ones deliberately—the entire ecosystem shifts. Behaviors, experiments, what gets tried, who speaks up in meetings—all begin to follow the new narrative root structure.

### Section 4: Implementation

**For Organizations** (corporate context): Establish a monthly "Narrative Inquiry" cohort within your intrapreneurship office or innovation function. Gather 8–12 practitioners across departments. In each session (90 minutes), follow this sequence: (1) One member names a limiting story they've noticed themselves or their team living by—"We are too large to move quickly," "This division doesn't understand innovation," "Our customers don't want what we're building." (2) The circle externalize it: "So the story you're telling is...?" (3) Together, hunt for contradictions: "When did you move quickly? What did that take? Who was involved?" Document these moments explicitly. (4) Compose a new narrative grounded in that evidence: "We have capacity to move quickly under these specific conditions. What would it take to create those conditions more often?" Record the old story and the new one side by side. By the third month, teams will reference these shared narratives when making decisions: "That's an old story. Here's what we're authoring now."

**For Government** (public service context): Embed narrative inquiry into policy design cycles and civil service learning cohorts. Before launching a new initiative, have the team surface and examine the stories they're telling about the public, the problem, and what's possible. "We tell ourselves citizens won't engage" is a story worth examining. Invite frontline workers—the ones closest to lived experience—to offer counter-narratives. They will say: "I've seen three times this month when citizens engaged deeply when we made it simple." Weave those stories into policy language and communication. This alone shifts implementation. Institutionalize it by training facilitators in each agency to run quarterly sessions. Make it a governance function, not a wellness activity.

**For Movements** (activist context): Use narrative inquiry as a core practice in organizer training and in movement meetings. Activists carry both empowering stories ("We are unstoppable") and disempowering ones ("Nothing ever changes," "People won't show up," "This is too big"). Create space before large actions to surface these stories explicitly. Have veteran organizers share how they've lived through the story "This time will fail like last time" and authoring a different one: "We know more now. We've learned. This is different." This is not cheerleading—it's narrative repair grounded in actual learning. Document these stories and circulate them. They become movement wisdom.

**For Products** (tech context): Embed narrative inquiry into product teams and user research. The stories engineers tell about users shape what gets built: "Users won't pay for this," "Users are lazy," "No one wants this feature." Surface these stories. Test them against actual user behavior. Let users tell their own stories about what they need and why. Reauthor your team's narrative based on what you learn. Use this to guide feature prioritization and communication strategy. Document the stories your product is telling about what users can do and who they can be. Design products that author better narratives about human capacity, not limiting ones.

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

A commons that practices narrative inquiry develops **collective sense-making capacity**. Members recognize they are interpreters of reality, not passive receivers of it. This is profound: it shifts the locus of agency from "the organization" or "the market" inward to "we who make meaning here." 

**Experimentation velocity increases**. When the story shifts from "we don't innovate" to "we innovate under these conditions," people begin testing those conditions. More experiments happen because the narrative permission structure has opened.

**Cross-silo understanding deepens**. When teams surface and compare their stories, they often discover they've been operating from contradictory narratives without knowing it. Externalizing these differences creates a foundation for genuine collaboration rather than blind friction.

**Resilience in setback**. When an experiment fails, a commons with strong narrative capacity doesn't collapse into "see, we knew it couldn't work." Instead, members recognize the failure as evidence that requires re-authoring the story, not confirmation of the old one. Setback becomes learning material rather than defeat.

**What risks emerge:**

**Narrative rigidity**: If this practice becomes routinized—a checkbox meeting rather than genuine inquiry—it can calcify new stories as firmly as the old ones. Watch for language that hardens: "This is who we are now" instead of "This is the story we're authoring *right now*." The pattern only works if stories remain fluid, subject to revision as conditions change.

**Shallow reframing**: Teams can slip into storytelling without attending to actual capacity. "We are innovators!" said with no corresponding changes in resource allocation, decision rights, or time structures is pure fiction—and people feel it. Re-authoring must root in observable shifts in behavior and structure, not just language.

**Resilience risk (Assessment score 3.0)**: This pattern sustains vitality by maintaining existing health; it does not automatically generate new adaptive capacity. If the commons becomes a space where members retell slightly better versions of the same fundamental stories, the system can feel more coherent but not actually become more resilient. The organization that tells itself "we are learning from failure" while still punishing failure quietly has not truly shifted. Watch for the gap between the story and the structure.

**Ownership diffusion**: If narrative authoring is treated as a facilitated exercise rather than a genuine commons practice, ownership remains with the facilitator or the "change function" rather than distributed. The pattern fails if people experience it as "they are making us tell better stories" rather than "we are authoring our own narrative."

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Case: Narrative Therapy in Organizational Change** (corporate context)

A mid-sized financial services firm had carried a story for a decade: "We are too regulated to innovate." Every innovation initiative bumped against this narrative. In 2019, a new Chief Innovation Officer gathered 15 practitioners across compliance, product, and operations and began monthly narrative inquiry sessions. In the first session, someone said: "We tell ourselves we can't move because of regulation. But I remember when we launched the mobile app in six weeks. How did we do that?" 

The group externalized the story and began hunting for moments when they *had* innovated under regulatory constraints. They found three. They examined what was different in those moments: leadership had given explicit permission, the team had involved compliance early rather than late, the goal was concrete. The group authored a new narrative: "We innovate by bringing compliance in as a design partner from the start, not as a gate at the end." 

Within six months, three new products had been approved and launched. The narrative shift had real consequence because it changed the *process*, not just the language. The old story produced a sequence (design → build → ask compliance). The new story produced a different sequence (clarify regulatory intent → co-design → build). Same constraints; different narrative; different behavior.

**Case: Narrative Inquiry in Activist Organizing** (activist context)

A climate justice organization noticed burnout clustering around a particular story: "Individual actions don't matter; the system is too big to move." This narrative was paralyzing organizing work. Organizers would train volunteers in direct action, but the volunteers would drop out after one action, convinced it had made no difference.

The organization began naming this story explicitly in organizer training and volunteer onboarding. They asked: "What stories about change are you carrying?" Many said: "Nothing changes" or "Only big corporations matter." The organization then taught volunteers to *see* their impact differently. After a local action that generated 200 community conversations, the organizer said: "We didn't close the factory. But we shifted what 200 people believe is possible. That's how change begins—in the stories people tell themselves about what's possible."

By making the impact narrative explicit—"We win by shifting what people believe is possible"—instead of implicit, retention improved. Volunteers stayed because they could see their work was already working. The story had shifted from "Nothing I do matters" to "I shift possibility; that's the work."

**Case: Product Narrative in Tech** (tech context)

A productivity software team was building features based on a story about users: "People are lazy; we need to remove friction." This narrative produced interfaces that automated away user agency. The product felt powerful to use but left users feeling like spectators in their own work.

During a narrative inquiry session grounded in user research, a designer said: "Listen to what users actually say: 'I want to understand what's happening.' Our story is that they want things done *for* them. But they want to understand. We've been authoring a narrative that diminishes them."

The team re-authored: "People want to move fast *and* understand what they're doing. Our job is to show them clearly what's happening, not hide it." This narrative shift changed what features got built. The same "reduce friction" goal was pursued differently: not by automating, but by making the system's logic transparent. User agency remained intact. The product shifted from doing things *to* users to doing things *with* them.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age of AI and distributed intelligence, narrative becomes both more plastic and more dangerous. AI systems are trained on narratives embedded in data—patterns of human storytelling, choice, and bias. When a commons practices narrative inquiry, they're increasingly doing it *alongside* AI systems that are also authoring narratives about what users can do, what's possible, what they should want.

**The new leverage**: AI can help surface narratives at scale. Machine learning can identify patterns in organizational communication—what stories get told repeatedly in Slack, email, meetings. A commons can feed these patterns back to members and ask: "Is this the story we want to keep telling?" This creates feedback loops that would be impossible to maintain manually.

**The new risk**: AI can also industrialize narrative capture. If an organization's stories are embedded in data and fed into systems, those narratives can be amplified, hardened, and fed back to users in ways that the original storytellers never explicitly chose. The story "people in this demographic don't innovate" could become embedded in an algorithm that stops recommending innovation resources to those people.

For the **tech context translation** specifically: products themselves are narratives now. An AI system that recommends what you should do next is authoring a story about what's possible for you. A product team building with AI must engage in explicit narrative inquiry: What story is this system telling about its users? Is it authoring agency or diminishing it? Is it telling users they are capable or limited?

The pattern becomes more critical and more delicate. Commons that practice narrative inquiry must expand to include examination of algorithmic narratives—the stories embedded in the systems they're building and being built around them. The shift from "What stories do we tell?" to "What stories are being told *through* the systems we're building?" becomes essential governance work.

---

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

—Members spontaneously reference the shared narratives the commons has authored. In meetings, someone says: "That's an old story. Here's what we're authoring now." The narrative work has become embedded in culture, not external to it.

—The commons surfaces *new* limiting stories regularly, rather than circling the same ones. This means the practice is alive and attending; people feel safe naming what they notice as conditions shift.

—Behavior changes in concrete ways that members trace back to narrative shifts. "We tried that because the story changed." The gap between story and structure closes incrementally.

—Members outside the formal commons practice have begun doing this work themselves. Narrative inquiry spreads as a capacity, not a program. A team decides mid-project to surface and revise the stories they're living by without being convened by the center.

**Signs of decay:**

—Narrative inquiry becomes a scheduled ritual with no genuine inquiry. People show up and go through motions. The stories named feel safe, comfortable, already pre-approved. No one is risking anything by speaking them.

—The commons surfaces stories but stops before the re-authoring work. Stories get named and then... nothing changes. No one bothers to test the new narrative against reality. The practice becomes cathartic rather than generative.

—Stories harden into new dogma. The organization that used to say "we can't innovate" now says "we are innovators" with the same rigidity. The narrative feels like orthodoxy rather than working hypothesis.

—The pattern is confined to a cohort while the rest of the organization operates under old narratives untouched. The commons becomes a refuge from organizational culture rather than a force that reshapes it.

**When to replant:**

Restart or redesign this practice when you notice a critical mass of new conditions or contradictions entering the system (new leaders, market shift, failed initiatives that don't fit the old story). This is the moment when the old narrative root system is weakest and people are ready to author differently. 

Redesign if the practice has become hollow—if stories are being named but nothing is shifting underneath.
