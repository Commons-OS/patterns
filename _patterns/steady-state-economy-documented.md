> A steady-state economy is an economy of stable or mildly fluctuating size. The term typically refers to a national economy, but it can also be applied to a local, regional, or global economy. An economy can reach a steady state after a period of growth or after a period of downsizing or degrowth. To be sustainable, a steady-state economy may not exceed ecological limits.

## 1. Overview

A steady-state economy is a model that contrasts with the dominant paradigm of perpetual economic growth. It is an economy where the total population and the total stock of physical capital are maintained at a constant level, with any depletion or depreciation balanced by new production. This model is not about stagnation, but rather about achieving a dynamic equilibrium, where qualitative development replaces quantitative growth. The primary goal is to establish a sustainable and equitable society that operates within the biophysical limits of the planet.

The concept of a steady-state economy has its roots in classical economics, with thinkers like Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill postulating a "stationary state" as the eventual endpoint of economic development. However, the modern conceptualization, most notably articulated by ecological economist Herman Daly, integrates ecological principles, recognizing that the economy is a subsystem of a finite global ecosystem. This perspective emphasizes that the Earth's resources are finite and that there are limits to the planet's capacity to absorb waste and pollution.

In a steady-state economy, the focus shifts from maximizing production and consumption (as measured by GDP) to optimizing human well-being and ecological stability. This involves a fundamental rethinking of economic goals and indicators. Instead of pursuing endless growth, a steady-state economy prioritizes the efficient use of resources, the equitable distribution of wealth, and the preservation of natural capital for future generations. It is a proactive approach to sustainability, aiming to prevent the environmental and social crises associated with unchecked economic expansion.

## 2. Core Principles

A steady-state economy is guided by a set of core principles that distinguish it from the growth-oriented model. These principles provide a framework for creating an economic system that is both sustainable and just.

### Sustainable Scale

The principle of sustainable scale asserts that the economy must operate within the regenerative and absorptive capacities of the ecosystem. This means that the rate of resource extraction should not exceed the rate at which natural resources can be replenished, and the rate of waste generation should not exceed the environment's capacity to assimilate it. This principle recognizes that the economy is a subsystem of the larger ecosphere and that its physical size cannot grow indefinitely on a finite planet. Achieving a sustainable scale may require a reduction in the overall throughput of materials and energy in high-consumption societies.

### Equitable Distribution

Equitable distribution is a cornerstone of the steady-state economy. It addresses the fair allocation of resources and wealth among the current generation and between the current and future generations. In a no-growth economy, the issue of distribution becomes more prominent, as it is no longer possible to rely on overall economic growth to improve the lot of the poor. A steady-state economy, therefore, necessitates policies that ensure a just distribution of income and wealth, such as progressive taxation, a social safety net, and limits on the range of income inequality. This principle is essential for social cohesion and political stability.

### Efficient Allocation

Efficient allocation in the context of a steady-state economy refers to the use of resources to maximize human well-being while minimizing environmental impact. This is not the same as the market efficiency of neoclassical economics, which often externalizes environmental and social costs. In a steady-state economy, prices should reflect the true costs of production, including the costs of resource depletion and pollution. This can be achieved through mechanisms such as cap-and-trade systems, ecological taxes, and the removal of environmentally harmful subsidies. The goal is to get the most well-being out of the least resource throughput.

## 3. Key Practices

The transition to a steady-state economy involves the implementation of a range of key practices and policies that are designed to stabilize the physical throughput of the economy while promoting social and ecological well-being. These practices are a departure from the growth-centric policies that currently dominate.

### Cap-Auction-Trade Systems

Cap-Auction-Trade (CAT) systems are a market-based mechanism for limiting the total throughput of resources. A cap is set on the total amount of a resource that can be extracted or imported, based on ecological limits. The rights to this limited amount of resource are then auctioned off to the highest bidders, and these rights can be traded in a secondary market. This approach creates a direct and effective way to control the quantity of resource use, while the auction revenue can be used to fund public services or returned to citizens as a dividend. CAT systems can be applied to a wide range of resources, including fossil fuels, minerals, and timber.

### Ecological Tax Reform

Ecological tax reform involves shifting the tax base from economic “goods” (like income and investment) to ecological “bads” (like pollution and resource depletion). This is often referred to as a “tax shift.” By taxing the activities that we want to discourage, such as carbon emissions and waste generation, and reducing taxes on the activities that we want to encourage, such as labor and innovation, we can create a powerful incentive for sustainable behavior. This approach internalizes the external costs of environmental degradation and promotes resource efficiency.

### Monetary and Financial System Reform

The current monetary system, based on fractional reserve banking and interest-bearing debt, has a built-in growth imperative. A steady-state economy requires a fundamental reform of the monetary and financial system to remove this imperative. This could involve a move towards a system of 100% reserve banking, which would give the government more control over the money supply and prevent the creation of money as debt by private banks. Other potential reforms include the introduction of demurrage (a charge on holding money), which would encourage circulation and investment, and the development of alternative currencies that are not based on interest.

## 4. Application Context

The principles and practices of a steady-state economy can be applied in various contexts, from local communities to national economies. The specific application will depend on the unique social, economic, and ecological conditions of the place in question. However, the underlying goal remains the same: to create a sustainable and equitable society that operates within planetary boundaries.

### National Level

At the national level, the transition to a steady-state economy would require a significant shift in public policy. This would involve the implementation of a comprehensive suite of measures, including cap-and-trade systems for key resources, ecological tax reform, and a reform of the monetary system. It would also require a reorientation of national goals, moving away from a narrow focus on GDP growth to a broader focus on human well-being and ecological sustainability. This would be a challenging and long-term process, requiring a high degree of political will and public support.

### Regional and Local Levels

At the regional and local levels, there is often more flexibility and opportunity for innovation. Communities can take the lead in implementing many of the key practices of a steady-state economy, such as promoting local food systems, developing renewable energy projects, and creating community-based currencies. These initiatives can help to build more resilient and self-reliant local economies, while also serving as models for what is possible at a larger scale. The Transition Town movement is a good example of how communities are already putting many of these ideas into practice.

## 5. Implementation

Implementing a steady-state economy is a complex and multifaceted challenge that requires a coordinated effort across all levels of society. It is not a one-size-fits-all solution, but rather a process of adaptation and experimentation. The following are some of the key steps and considerations for implementation.

### Building a New Narrative

The first and most important step is to build a new narrative that challenges the dominant paradigm of perpetual economic growth. This involves communicating the vision of a steady-state economy in a way that is compelling and accessible to a wide audience. It is about showing that a steady-state economy is not about sacrifice and austerity, but about creating a better and more fulfilling life for all. This requires a concerted effort from academics, activists, artists, and community leaders to change the public conversation about the economy and the environment.

### Developing New Indicators

To move beyond the obsession with GDP growth, we need to develop and adopt new indicators that measure what really matters. These indicators should track progress towards a steady-state economy by measuring things like human well-being, social equity, and ecological health. The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) and the Happy Planet Index (HPI) are examples of alternative indicators that are already being used in some jurisdictions. The adoption of these indicators at the national and international level would be a major step towards shifting the focus of public policy.

## 6. Evidence & Impact

While no country has fully implemented a steady-state economy, there is a growing body of evidence and research that supports its principles and practices. This evidence comes from a variety of sources, including historical examples, contemporary case studies, and computer modeling.

### Historical Precedents

Throughout history, there have been many societies that have lived in a state of relative equilibrium with their environment for long periods of time. These societies, often indigenous cultures, had a deep understanding of the local ecosystem and developed sophisticated social and cultural mechanisms for managing resources sustainably. While these societies were not modern industrial economies, they provide valuable lessons about the possibility of a long-term, stable relationship between humans and the natural world.

### Contemporary Case Studies

There are a number of contemporary case studies that demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of a steady-state approach. For example, the state of Vermont in the United States has adopted the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) as an official measure of its economic well-being. This has led to a greater focus on policies that improve the quality of life and protect the environment, rather than simply maximizing economic growth. Similarly, the city of a Curitiba in Brazil has become a world-renowned model of sustainable urban planning, with its integrated public transportation system, extensive green spaces, and high rates of recycling.

## 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

The Cognitive Era, characterized by the rise of artificial intelligence, big data, and the Internet of Things, presents both new challenges and new opportunities for the transition to a steady-state economy. The transformative power of these technologies can either exacerbate the problems of the growth-oriented economy or be harnessed to create a more sustainable and equitable world.

### Challenges

One of the main challenges is the potential for these technologies to accelerate the dematerialization of the economy, leading to a further disconnect between economic activity and the physical world. This could create the illusion that we can have infinite growth without any environmental consequences, which would undermine the case for a steady-state economy. There is also the risk that these technologies could be used to create a more centralized and controlled society, where the benefits are concentrated in the hands of a few. The energy consumption of large-scale data centers and AI models is another significant concern.

### Opportunities

On the other hand, the technologies of the Cognitive Era also offer powerful tools for building a steady-state economy. For example, AI and big data can be used to create more sophisticated models of the economy and the environment, which can help us to better understand the complex interactions between the two. The Internet of Things can be used to create a more efficient and responsive energy system, and to track the flow of materials through the economy. These technologies can also be used to create new forms of collaborative consumption and production, which can help to reduce our overall material footprint.

## 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

The Steady-State Economy model has a strong alignment with the principles of the commons. It seeks to create an economic system that is both sustainable and equitable, and that recognizes the importance of shared resources and collective well-being. The following is an assessment of the alignment of the Steady-State Economy with the seven dimensions of the commons.

### Shared Resources (Score: 5/5)

The Steady-State Economy is fundamentally about the management of shared resources. It recognizes that the Earth's natural resources are a common heritage of all humanity and that they must be managed in a way that is both sustainable and just. The principle of sustainable scale is a direct expression of this, as it seeks to ensure that the rate of resource use does not exceed the regenerative capacity of the ecosystem. The practice of cap-and-trade systems is a practical mechanism for managing shared resources in a way that is both efficient and equitable.

### Community Governance (Score: 4/5)

The Steady-State Economy promotes a more decentralized and participatory form of governance. The principle of re-localization of the economy is a key part of this, as it seeks to empower local communities to take control of their own economic destiny. The emphasis on community-based currencies and cooperative business models also supports a more democratic and community-oriented approach to economic governance. However, the transition to a steady-state economy will also require a strong role for national and international governance, particularly in setting the overall limits on resource use.

### Social Equity (Score: 5/5)

Social equity is a core principle of the Steady-State Economy. The principle of equitable distribution is a direct response to the fact that a no-growth economy requires a more just distribution of wealth and income. The practices of a shorter workweek, job sharing, and a strong social safety net are all designed to promote social equity and well-being. The focus on human and social capital, rather than physical capital, also supports a more equitable and people-centered approach to development.
