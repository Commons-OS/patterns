Define your personal sufficiency threshold—the specific amount of money, possessions, and status that constitutes 'enough'—and design life around it.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Lynne Twist / Vicki Robin.

### Section 1: Context

In affluent Western systems, the primary driver of economic participation is perpetual growth: more income, more accumulation, more visible status. This creates a relentless loop where satisfaction remains always one purchase, one promotion, one achievement away. The relationship domain fractures under this pressure—people sacrifice time with kin, community engagement, and creative practice to feed the growth machine. Organisations and governments reinforce this by measuring success exclusively in quantitative terms (GDP, profit, market share), leaving no language for sufficiency. The activist and degrowth traditions have begun naming this as a design flaw, not a feature. Yet most individuals lack a concrete tool to step sideways from the treadmill. They feel the tension but cannot articulate—let alone act on—what "enough" actually means for them. This pattern addresses that gap: it treats sufficiency as a design parameter you can specify, rather than a vague aspiration. When implemented, it shifts the ecosystem from infinite consumption to bounded flourishing, freeing energy for relationships, stewardship, and adaptive capacity in communities that depend on stable belonging.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Enough vs. Number.**

The **Number** side—quantification as proof—says: more is measurable, comparable, and defensible. You can show your salary, your portfolio, your possession count to others and yourself. The Number creates clarity about status and progress. The **Enough** side—sufficiency as sufficiency—says: beyond a threshold, more doesn't increase wellbeing; it consumes attention and erodes the time available for what actually matters: relationships, creation, rest, collective care.

The tension breaks when people optimise for Number without naming Enough. They accumulate until collapse—burnout, relationship dissolution, health failure—and then call it a personal failure rather than a design flaw. Organisations extract maximum labour under the guise of "growth opportunities." Governments tie public benefit to GDP expansion, locking policy into perpetual intensification. Activists burn out because they internalise the scarcity mindset they're trying to critique.

But the tension also breaks if Enough becomes mere philosophy—a quiet acceptance of deprivation without naming the actual threshold. True resolution requires both: a clear, specific Number that defines your personal sufficiency, *and* a commitment to design your life (relationships, work, pace, consumption, status-seeking) around that boundary. This is not austerity. It is precision engineering of a bounded life that can actually hold vitality.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, calculate and name your specific Enough Number across three domains (income, possessions, status markers), then redesign your daily decisions, work arrangements, and community relationships to honour and defend that boundary.**

This pattern works by making the implicit explicit. Most people carry a shadowy, guilt-laden sense that they want "less," but they've never actually defined what less means. Lynne Twist calls this the "scarcity loop"—the belief that there is never enough, so you must always reach for more. Vicki Robin's *Your Money or Your Life* operationalizes this by asking practitioners to calculate their real hourly wage (actual income divided by actual working hours, including commute, recovery time, work-related expenses), then use that as a lens to ask: "Is this purchase worth the life energy it costs?"

The mechanism is simple but transformative. When you name your Enough Number—say, $60,000 annual income, 500 possessions, zero external status metrics—you create a decision filter. Opportunities and desires are no longer evaluated against an infinite horizon ("Could I earn more? Should I?"). They're evaluated against your named boundary: "This job pays $90,000. My Enough Number is $60,000. Do I want to trade an extra $30,000 for the time and energy this will consume?" 

This creates what systems theorists call a **stabilizing feedback loop**. Your life settles into a shape that regenerates itself without constant optimization. You know when you have enough, so you can stop. The nervous system relaxes. Relationships can deepen because you're not perpetually in scarcity-response. Work can become stewardship rather than extraction—you're not desperate for the next promotion.

The pattern also reveals **what was hidden by the Number obsession**: your actual values. When you stop chasing the next rung, you see what you actually choose to do with time and energy. That visibility is the seedbed for authentic participation in commons—in your neighbourhood, your family system, your activist cell, your craft community.

### Section 4: Implementation

**1. Calculation phase (2–4 weeks)**

Define three numbers with real specificity:
- **Income sufficiency**: Calculate your annual cost of living including healthcare, housing, food, transport, child/elder care, and a 10% buffer. Add the specific annual amount you want available for learning, creativity, or community contribution. This is your Enough Number for income. Write it down. Make it non-negotiable in conversations.
- **Possession sufficiency**: Walk your living space. Count categories (tools, clothes, books, household items) that you actually use. Add 10% for things you genuinely enjoy but use seasonally. That's your ceiling. For practitioners in **activist** traditions, this also means identifying tools and resources you steward for the collective—those live outside the personal count.
- **Status sufficiency**: Name 3–5 specific, modest markers that signal to you that you're contributing and seen (a title, a community role, public credit for your work). Resist the temptation to add "just one more." This is your boundary against status inflation.

**2. Life redesign (ongoing)**

For **corporate** contexts: Use your Enough Number as the basis for a salary negotiation ceiling, not a floor. Propose a role with the income you need, reduced hours, and explicit permission to refuse promotions that exceed your boundary. Build this into your employment agreement. Track actual life energy expenditure monthly.

For **government** contexts: Advocate for sufficiency-based policy design—public goods (transit, housing, healthcare, childcare) calibrated to meet the Enough Number for your population cohort, rather than means-testing that punishes people for crossing thresholds. Pilot neighbourhood-scale "sufficiency audits" that measure whether basic needs are met, rather than growth metrics.

For **activist** traditions: Build your organization's sustainability plan around the Enough Numbers of your core team. If your team cannot live on what the movement generates, you've designed an extractive system, not a commons. Calculate the actual cost of sustained activism and build fundraising around that, not around "growth" in budget size.

For **tech** contexts: If you're building sufficiency modeling AI, design it to help practitioners reverse-engineer their Enough Number from spending and time-use data. Let the model show the correlation between income increases and actual wellbeing gains for your user, then identify the inflection point where more money stops correlating with more life satisfaction. Use that as the seeding number for redesign.

**3. Defense phase (ongoing)**

Once you've named your number, you'll face pressure—social, professional, familial—to exceed it. Design active defenses:
- Schedule a monthly "Enough conversation" with a trusted peer (ideally someone also practicing this pattern). Share temptations and recommit.
- When opportunity pulls you past your boundary, write a 2-sentence refusal that names your value (e.g., "I'm declining the promotion because I've designed my life around $60,000 income and deep family time, and this role threatens both").
- Translate your Enough into visible markers others can understand. If you're staying in a modest home, a skill-share you lead, a regular community meal you host—make your sufficiency visible as *thriving*, not deprivation.

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

When you defend your Enough Number, three capacities emerge. First, **relational depth**: you have time and presence for people in your inner circle. You're not perpetually optimizing or checking email. Second, **creative agency**: the energy freed from status-seeking and accumulation naturally channels into making, learning, and contributing things that matter to you. You become a participant in commons, not just a consumer extracting value. Third, **adaptive resilience in community**: because your income requirement is lower and your possessions are curated, you're less fragile. Economic downturns don't destroy you. You can collaborate without desperation.

**What risks emerge:**

The commons assessment shows **resilience at 3.0**—moderate. The key risk is **rigidity**: if your Enough Number becomes dogma rather than a living boundary, it can calcify into a new form of scarcity thinking ("I must never exceed my number, even when collective needs require it"). Watch for practitioners who use sufficiency as moral superiority, shaming others still in the Number chase. This inverts the pattern into a new hierarchy.

A second risk: **social friction and isolation**. When your Enough Number differs sharply from your family's or professional culture's expectations, you become the odd one out. Some practitioners retreat into parallel communities that validate sufficiency, losing the ability to influence the wider system. The pattern needs **thick social support**—others practicing alongside you—or loneliness can erode commitment.

A third: **underdeclared costs**. Some practitioners set their Enough Number too low, hiding true costs (mental health care, eldercare, emergency reserves). This creates delayed collapse rather than stable design. Your Enough Number must be honest, not aspirational.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Vicki Robin's own practice (1990s–present):** After publishing *Your Money or Your Life*, Robin calculated her Enough Number at approximately $25,000 annually (in 1990s dollars). She then designed her life around that boundary: a modest home, a small circle of close relationships, and work that aligned with her values rather than income maximization. When offered lucrative speaking engagements that would push her past that number, she declined or redirected the excess income to organisations aligned with her values. This wasn't deprivation—her published writing and community engagement deepened precisely because she wasn't chasing the next opportunity. Her pattern became replicable; thousands of *Your Money or Your Life* readers have named their own Enough Numbers and restructured work accordingly.

**Lynne Twist and the Pachamama Alliance (2000s–present):** Twist, author of *The Soul of Money*, embedded sufficiency thinking into the Alliance's organisational design. Team members negotiate salaries based on their actual Enough Numbers, not market rates. This created unusual stability in a non-profit that typically experiences activist burnout. The practice also shaped how the Alliance works with Indigenous communities in the Amazon—rather than imposing Western metrics of "success," they ask communities to define their own sufficiency thresholds and support those boundaries. A village might say: "We need $80,000 annually to maintain our food systems and cultural practice; beyond that, we don't want extractive development." The Alliance then structures conservation agreements around that Enough Number, not around maximizing land protection per dollar.

**Activist housing collective (North America, 2010s):** A network of social justice organisations created a shared housing model where members committed to an Enough Number of $35,000 annual income. The collective pooled housing costs, childcare, and tool libraries. Members who earned more contributed the excess to the collective fund; members with lower income were supported without means-testing. This allowed precarious activists (community organisers, mutual aid coordinators) to sustain their work without second jobs or burnout. The pattern scaled to eight cities because it made visible what activist movements usually hide: the actual cost of sustained care work, and the collective responsibility to meet it. In **government** context translation, this model influenced municipal discussions about universal basic income—the collective's data showed that when income sufficiency was guaranteed, people actually *increased* community contribution, contradicting fears of freeloading.

---

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age where AI can model your spending patterns, predict your consumption, and optimise your income infinitely, **Sufficiency Modeling AI** becomes either a tool for deeper entrapment or a lever for freedom—depending on how it's designed and deployed.

The risk: AI trained on aggregate consumer data will optimise you *toward* your current trajectory, not *away* from it. If you spend $80,000 annually, the model predicts you'll spend $85,000 next year and recommends income sources to support that. It becomes an agent of the Number, not Enough.

The opportunity: Reverse the design. Build AI that helps practitioners identify their true Enough Number by correlating actual spending with reported wellbeing, time with kin, creative output, and community participation. Show the inflection point where more income stops correlating with these metrics. Let the model surface what you're currently paying attention to—and what you're not. This shifts the cognitive work from "How much should I earn?" to "What am I optimising for, and is that what I actually value?"

The second leverage: **Collective sufficiency modeling**. Rather than each person calculating alone, AI can help communities design infrastructure and policy around population-level Enough Numbers. What does a neighbourhood need—in transit, housing, food, childcare, healthcare—to meet everyone's sufficiency threshold? This transforms the pattern from individual practice into commons-level design. Government and corporate systems can then be held to that standard.

The risk unique to AI: automation of the *defense* phase. A sufficiency-aligned AI assistant could intercept opportunities that exceed your boundary and decline them on your behalf. This offloads the practice of *choosing* sufficiency—the vital work of recommitting regularly—to the machine. The pattern atrophies into a setting, not a living practice.

---

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

- You can articulate your Enough Number to someone in your life and feel grounded, not ashamed. The number feels *chosen*, not imposed or aspirational.
- You refuse opportunities that exceed your boundary without resentment. The refusal feels like protecting something, not missing out.
- Your relationships have deepened measurably (more time together, more presence, fewer conflicts about money). You have space for surprise and responsiveness to others' needs.
- You notice yourself noticing what you already have—a shift from perpetual scanning for more to actual appreciation of what's present.

**Signs of decay:**

- Your Enough Number has drifted upward without conscious revision. You tell yourself you "need" more now, but the desire is diffuse, not grounded in actual cost-of-living changes.
- You've stopped talking about your boundary with others; it's become a private shame or a secret virtue. The pattern has inverted from shared practice into isolation.
- You feel righteously superior to people still chasing the Number. Sufficiency has become ideology, not wisdom.
- Your actual possessions, time commitments, and income have crept past your stated Enough Number, and you've noticed but not adjusted. The pattern is hollow.

**When to replant:**

Restart this practice when you sense scarcity creeping back in—when you're checking bank balances anxiously, comparing yourself to peers, or feeling "behind" despite meeting your stated Enough Number. The pattern needs seasonal renewal, not one-time calibration. Revise your number annually (accounting for real cost-of-living shifts), and recommit publicly to someone practicing alongside you. If rigidity has set in, widen your circle of practitioners to include people whose Enough Numbers differ from yours—rebuild the pattern as dialogue, not doctrine.
