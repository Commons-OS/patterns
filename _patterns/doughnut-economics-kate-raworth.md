### 1. Overview (150-300 words)

Doughnut Economics is a groundbreaking economic model and framework developed by British economist Kate Raworth. It redefines the goal of economics, moving away from the endless pursuit of GDP growth towards a more holistic objective: meeting the needs of all people within the means of the living planet. The model is visualized as a doughnut, with a social foundation of well-being that no one should fall below, and an ecological ceiling of planetary boundaries that humanity should not overshoot. The space between these two rings is the “safe and just space for humanity.”

The core problem Doughnut Economics addresses is the inherent unsustainability and inequality of the current economic system. It provides a compelling alternative to the prevailing economic paradigm, which has led to severe environmental degradation and social disparities. By offering a clear and intuitive visual framework, it empowers policymakers, businesses, and communities to design and implement more regenerative and distributive economic strategies.

The concept was first introduced by Kate Raworth in a 2012 Oxfam report, “A Safe and Just Space for Humanity.” It was further elaborated in her 2017 book, “Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist.” The model has since gained international recognition and is being adopted by cities, regions, and organizations worldwide as a tool for sustainable development.

### 2. Core Principles (3-7 principles, 200-400 words)

Doughnut Economics is built upon seven core principles that challenge traditional economic thinking and provide a new framework for the 21st century.

1.  **Change the Goal.** The primary objective of economic activity should not be the endless pursuit of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, but rather to achieve a balance between meeting the needs of all people and protecting the planet. This means shifting the focus from a quantitative goal to a qualitative one: creating a safe and just space for humanity to thrive.

2.  **See the Big Picture.** The economy is not a separate, self-contained system, but is deeply embedded within society and the natural world. This principle calls for a holistic view that recognizes the interdependence of the economy, society, and the environment, and the need to manage the economy in a way that respects social and ecological boundaries.

3.  **Nurture Human Nature.** The traditional economic model is based on a narrow and inaccurate view of human nature, portraying people as rational, self-interested, and insatiable consumers. Doughnut Economics recognizes that humans are social, cooperative, and adaptable beings, and that economic systems should be designed to nurture these aspects of our nature.

4.  **Get Savvy with Systems.** The economy is a complex, dynamic, and unpredictable system, not a simple, linear machine. This principle encourages a systems-thinking approach that embraces complexity, feedback loops, and uncertainty, and that seeks to build resilience and adaptability into the economic system.

5.  **Design to Distribute.** The current economic system is designed to concentrate wealth and power in the hands of a few. Doughnut Economics calls for a more distributive design, where value is shared more equitably among all stakeholders. This can be achieved through a variety of mechanisms, such as employee ownership, fair taxation, and investment in public services.

6.  **Create to Regenerate.** The industrial economy has been based on a degenerative model of “take, make, use, lose,” which has led to widespread environmental degradation. Doughnut Economics advocates for a regenerative approach, where economic activity is designed to restore and replenish natural resources, rather than deplete them. This involves shifting to a circular economy, where waste is minimized and resources are reused and recycled.

7.  **Be Agnostic about Growth.** Doughnut Economics recognizes that growth is a natural and healthy phase of development, but that nothing grows forever. Instead of being addicted to growth, we should be agnostic about it, and focus on creating economies that thrive, whether or not they are growing.

### 3. Key Practices (5-10 practices, 300-600 words)

The principles of Doughnut Economics are put into action through a variety of practices that can be adapted to different contexts, from cities to businesses.

1.  **Downscaling the Doughnut.** This involves translating the global Doughnut into a local context, such as a city or region. This process, known as creating a "City Portrait," involves a participatory approach where local stakeholders identify their social and ecological priorities. For example, the city of Amsterdam created its own City Doughnut to guide its post-pandemic recovery, focusing on areas like affordable housing, sustainable food systems, and a circular economy.

2.  **Doughnut Unrolled.** This is a workshop methodology that helps organizations and communities explore the implications of the Doughnut for their own operations and strategies. It involves a deep dive into the five design lenses of Purpose, Networks, Governance, Ownership, and Finance, to identify opportunities for transformative change. For instance, a business might use this process to rethink its ownership structure to better align with its social and environmental goals.

3.  **Data Portrait of a Place.** This practice involves gathering and visualizing data to create a comprehensive picture of a place's performance against the social and ecological goals of the Doughnut. This data-driven approach helps to identify key challenges and opportunities, and to track progress over time. The city of Brussels, for example, has developed a detailed data portrait to inform its transition to a Doughnut economy.

4.  **Community-Led Workshops.** These are workshops and events organized by local communities to learn about the Doughnut and to co-create solutions for their own context. These grassroots initiatives are a key part of the Doughnut Economics movement, as they empower citizens to take ownership of their collective future. In the UK, numerous community groups have organized Doughnut workshops to explore issues such as local food systems, renewable energy, and community wealth building.

5.  **Business Design for the Doughnut.** This involves applying the principles of Doughnut Economics to the design of businesses. This means moving beyond the traditional focus on maximizing profits to a more holistic approach that considers the well-being of all stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, and the environment. The Doughnut Economics Action Lab (DEAL) provides tools and resources to help businesses on this journey, such as the “Doughnut Design for Business” tool.

6.  **Policy and Governance Innovation.** This practice involves developing new policies and governance structures that support the transition to a Doughnut economy. This can include things like new forms of taxation, regulation, and public investment that incentivize regenerative and distributive practices. For example, the city of Nanaimo in Canada has integrated the Doughnut into its strategic planning processes.

7.  **Educational Initiatives.** This involves integrating the concepts of Doughnut Economics into educational curricula at all levels, from primary schools to universities. This is crucial for building the knowledge and skills needed to create a new generation of economic thinkers and practitioners. The DEAL website features a wide range of educational resources, including lesson plans, videos, and games.

### 4. Application Context (200-300 words)

### 7. Cognitive Era Considerations (200-400 words)

- **Cognitive Augmentation Potential**: Artificial intelligence and automation can significantly enhance the implementation of Doughnut Economics. AI-powered data analytics can be used to create more sophisticated and dynamic “data portraits” of cities and regions, providing real-time insights into social and ecological performance. Machine learning algorithms can help to identify complex interconnections and feedback loops within the economic system, enabling more effective and targeted interventions. For example, AI could be used to optimize supply chains for circularity, or to develop personalized education programs that promote sustainable lifestyles.

- **Human-Machine Balance**: While AI can be a powerful tool for analysis and optimization, the transition to a Doughnut economy is ultimately a human endeavor. The process of setting social and ecological goals, of co-creating solutions, and of building a shared vision for the future requires empathy, creativity, and collaboration – qualities that are uniquely human. The role of technology should be to augment, not replace, human intelligence and agency. It is crucial to ensure that the development and deployment of AI is guided by ethical principles and a commitment to social and ecological well-being.

- **Evolution Outlook**: In the cognitive era, the Doughnut model is likely to evolve in several ways. We can expect to see the development of more sophisticated and interactive digital tools for exploring and applying the Doughnut. The integration of AI and blockchain technologies could enable new forms of decentralized and democratic governance, allowing for more transparent and accountable decision-making. The Doughnut could also become a key framework for guiding the development of artificial general intelligence, ensuring that these powerful new technologies are aligned with the long-term interests of humanity and the planet.

### 8. Commons Alignment Assessment (v2.0)

This assessment evaluates the pattern based on the Commons OS v2.0 framework, which focuses on the pattern's ability to enable resilient collective value creation.

**1. Stakeholder Architecture:**
Doughnut Economics provides a robust stakeholder architecture by defining a "social foundation" (the rights of all people) and an "ecological ceiling" (the responsibilities we have to the planet). This explicitly includes non-human stakeholders (the environment) and future generations by focusing on planetary boundaries. It moves beyond traditional economic models by architecting rights and responsibilities across a comprehensive set of stakeholders.

**2. Value Creation Capability:**
The framework fundamentally reorients the goal of economic activity from pure financial output to collective value creation. It champions the creation of social value (well-being, equity, justice) and ecological value (regeneration, biodiversity). The principles of "design to distribute" and "create to regenerate" are direct mandates to build systems that produce diverse forms of value for all, not just monetary wealth for a few.

**3. Resilience & Adaptability:**
The pattern is designed to help systems thrive on change. By being "agnostic about growth" and promoting a systems-thinking approach ("Get Savvy with Systems"), it encourages the development of economies that are adaptable and resilient. The goal is to maintain coherence within the safe and just space of the Doughnut, even when faced with external shocks and complexity.

**4. Ownership Architecture:**
Doughnut Economics challenges conventional ownership by promoting the principle of "design to distribute." This encourages the exploration of alternative ownership models like cooperatives and community wealth building, where rights and responsibilities are more broadly shared. It reframes ownership as a form of stewardship over resources for collective benefit, rather than just a claim to monetary equity.

**5. Design for Autonomy:**
The framework is highly compatible with autonomous systems. As a set of core principles rather than a rigid, top-down mandate, it can be adopted by decentralized networks, DAOs, and AI-driven systems. Its emphasis on local adaptation through "City Portraits" and community-led initiatives demonstrates a design that empowers autonomous, context-aware action with low coordination overhead.

**6. Composability & Interoperability:**
The pattern acts as a meta-framework that is highly composable with other patterns. It provides a high-level vision and a set of guiding principles that can integrate and align various other approaches, such as the circular economy, platform cooperativism, and regenerative agriculture. Its systemic nature makes it an ideal foundation for building larger, interoperable value-creation systems.

**7. Fractal Value Creation:**
The value-creation logic of the Doughnut is explicitly designed to be fractal. The framework can be "downscaled" and applied at multiple scales, from individuals and households to cities, regions, and potentially nations. This scalability allows the core logic of creating a safe and just space to be replicated and adapted across different levels of social organization, creating a coherent, multi-scale system.

**Overall Score: 5 (Value Creation Architecture)**

**Rationale:**
Doughnut Economics provides a complete and comprehensive architecture for resilient collective value creation. It redefines the purpose of an economy and provides clear principles and design lenses to guide the creation of regenerative and distributive systems. The framework's strength lies in its holistic, systemic, and fractal design, making it a foundational pattern for building a commons-based economy.

**Opportunities for Improvement:**
- Develop more concrete, interoperable data standards for measuring the social and ecological dimensions of the Doughnut to enhance its use in automated and AI-driven systems.
- Create more specific sub-patterns for applying the Doughnut's design lenses (Purpose, Networks, Governance, Ownership, Finance) within different organizational contexts (e.g., DAOs, platform co-ops).
- Strengthen the link between the ecological ceiling and the rights of nature, formalizing the legal and operational responsibilities owed to the environment as a stakeholder.
