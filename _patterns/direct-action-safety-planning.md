Direct action participants require explicit safety plans—about escalation risks, arrest procedures, legal support, and communication—to prevent harm and enable sustained participation.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Direct Action, Safety Culture.

### Section 1: Context

Direct action campaigns—whether protest marches, civil disobedience, workplace actions, or infrastructure interventions—exist in a state of constant tension between urgency and fragility. Participants range from experienced organisers to first-time activists, often operating across loose networks with minimal institutional binding. The ecosystem is volatile: police presence, counter-protesters, and internal miscommunication create cascading harm. Organisations stewarding these actions face a peculiar pressure: move fast enough to maintain momentum and moral clarity, yet slow enough to prevent people from being arrested, injured, or psychologically shattered. Without explicit safety protocols, participation becomes a lottery—some people leave energised and committed; others leave traumatised, with shattered trust in the group. Corporate security teams watch these dynamics to predict threat escalation. Government agencies design response protocols partly by observing where activist safety planning fails. Tech workers embedded in activist movements face the specific hazard of being targeted for digital surveillance or doxxing because of their technical roles. The pattern arises because direct action, by definition, involves stepping outside the comfort zone of normalcy. That step requires a container—not a cage, but a clear map.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Direct vs. Planning.**

Direct action thrives on immediacy, spontaneity, and moral urgency. The moment a group pauses to draft a 40-page safety manual, it risks losing the emotional coherence and responsive energy that makes action compelling. Activists fear that safety planning becomes bureaucratic drag—that it shifts power to the people with clipboards and checklists rather than those on the frontline with clarity and courage.

Planning, conversely, insists that harm is predictable. Arrest is foreseeable; medical emergencies happen; people panic. Without explicit agreements on hand signals, legal contact numbers, de-escalation roles, and post-arrest protocols, the action becomes a vector for secondary trauma. Parents get arrested without knowing their child is safe. People get hit and don't know where to find medical support. Communication breaks down the moment intensity rises.

The real conflict: **directness demands speed and emotional truth; safety demands coordination and contingency thinking.** When unresolved, this tension produces two failure modes. *First,* reckless action—people get hurt because no one named the actual risks. *Second,* paralyzing caution—the group spends so much time planning that the moment for action passes, and people disengage because they sense the group isn't actually willing to act. Both drain vitality. The pattern must bridge this without collapsing either force into the other.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, embed safety planning directly into action design from the first organising meeting, treating it as a seed condition rather than an obstacle—co-developing escalation scenarios, legal reality, and role clarity alongside the vision of the action itself.**

Safety planning, done well, doesn't slow direct action. It *focuses* it. The mechanism works through four shifts:

**First: naming risk as shared intelligence, not fear.** When an organiser says to participants "Police in this district typically use line tactics to kettle crowds; we'll practice an exit route," they are not dampening courage—they are distributing knowledge. Participants who know what to expect stay calmer, make better choices, and maintain focus on the action's core purpose. The group's collective competence rises.

**Second: establishing roles as a form of agency, not control.** A safety plan that assigns de-escalators, medics, legal liaisons, and communication coordinators distributes power horizontally. Each person knows their anchor role and their liberation from other roles. This clarity enables trust. People move faster and more decisively because they don't have to improvise their function under stress.

**Third: creating communication branches that prevent cascading failure.** Direct action is noisy. If legal support doesn't know who's been arrested, if medics don't know where participants have scattered, if organisers can't reach the front line, the system fragments. Pre-planned communication (hand signals, phone trees, secure channels) keeps the nervous system intact even when the environment becomes chaotic.

**Fourth: building psychological permission to leave.** The most vital safety planning explicitly normalises the choice to step back. A participant who knows they can hand their role to someone else without shame, who has been told in advance "leaving early is okay," who has named their personal limits—that person will push further, not pull back, because they are not fighting their own fear of entrapment.

This pattern sustains the system's functioning without requiring the group to become rigid or slow. It plants safety as a seed at the root, not as an afterthought.

### Section 4: Implementation

**Map the actual threat landscape.** Before writing a single safety guideline, gather the group and make a shared risk assessment. What are the real escalation vectors? Is there a history of police aggression in this location? Are counter-protesters expected? Could social media doxxing target participants? Write this on a whiteboard so everyone sees the same picture. This step takes 90 minutes and prevents months of anxious improvisation.

**Assign and train role-holders, in person, before the action.** Don't have a plan that exists only on paper. Run a table-top simulation: walk through what happens if someone is arrested, if someone is injured, if the crowd splits. Role-holders (medics, legal liaisons, de-escalators, comms) should practice their function at least once with the actual group. This transforms roles from abstract to embodied. Activist organisations do this routinely; corporate security should borrow this practice when staging security response exercises. Government agencies often skip this, leading to brittle protocols that fail under pressure.

**Create a visual, memorable communication system.** Establish hand signals for "disperse," "regroup," "medic needed," "police moving." Print wallet cards with escalation responses and legal contact numbers. Use secure messaging apps with pre-written templates so people don't have to compose messages while stressed. Tech workers embedded in activist groups should audit these systems for surveillance vectors—suggest encrypted channels if legal contact info is sensitive. Most groups use a simple matrix: green (safe to proceed), yellow (caution, monitor), red (disperse/leave).

**Write and share explicit arrest procedures.** Name what happens: where people go, who calls whom, what they do NOT do (provoke, resist, stay silent about tactics). Make sure everyone knows: Do not use your real name if detained for questioning (in jurisdictions where that's legal). Do not sign anything without a lawyer. Do know the bail amount so supporters can prepare. Include the three phone numbers that matter: legal support hotline, bail fund, emergency contact.

**Hold a pre-action safety briefing with all participants.** This happens 30 minutes before the action starts. Go through the risk map, roles, signals, and exit routes. Ask: "Who here is carrying medication we should know about?" "Who is new to this?" "Does anyone have mobility constraints that affect where they can stand?" "What's your personal limit—how long will you stay?" This normalises the conversation and catches last-minute hazards. Activist groups do this; corporate security rarely does, and government agencies often skip it in favour of remote coordination.

**Establish a clear post-action debrief.**  Within 24–48 hours, gather key people to share what actually happened versus what was planned. What communication broke down? Who felt unsafe and why? Collect this feedback into the next safety plan. This closes the loop and prevents the same gaps from repeating.

---

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

Participants stay engaged across multiple actions because they aren't traumatised by the first one. Trust in group competence deepens—people sense that the organisers have thought through the terrain. People with different risk tolerances can participate at their own edges; a parent can stay 30 minutes, a student can stay 4 hours, both feel welcome. Legal support becomes proactive rather than reactive, catching people before they spiral. De-escalators have explicit permission and training to intervene early, preventing small conflicts from becoming police trigger points. The action maintains its emotional coherence and moral clarity because people aren't drowning in fear.

**What risks emerge:**

*Decay mode: ritualization.* Safety planning can become rote—printed forms that no one reads, role assignments to people who haven't trained. Watch for actions where the safety briefing is skipped because "we always do this." Resilience score (3.0) reflects this vulnerability: without active renewal, the pattern hollows.

*Failure mode: false security.* A group with a written safety plan can become complacent, taking bigger risks than they've actually trained for. A detailed arrest procedure doesn't protect someone from police brutality if the group doesn't drill de-escalation.

*Structural risk: power hoarding.* If safety planning is controlled by a small core team and imposed top-down, it breeds resentment. Activist groups mitigate this by co-creating plans. Corporate and government contexts often centralise safety planning, creating brittle systems that don't adapt to local conditions.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**The Movement for Black Lives (2014–present).** After Ferguson, protest safety planning became explicit practice across US cities. Groups developed standardised hand signals, trained street medics and legal liaisons, and created rapid-response bail funds. The 2020 uprising saw refinement: protest organisers used encrypted apps to communicate real-time threat assessment, designated meeting points if crowds were kettled, and briefed participants on the specific police tactics used in each precinct. Safety planning was not separate from action—it was the skeleton that let thousands of people move as a coherent body. Legal support teams documented arrests, bail procedures, and follow-up trauma care. Vitality was sustained across months of weekly actions because the nervous system didn't fray.

**Standing Rock, 2016–2017.** Water protectors faced police in riot gear, dogs, and water cannons. Safety planning was multilayered: elders designated sacred roles and safe zones; medics trained in hypothermia and tear gas exposure; legal teams pre-positioned observers to document police tactics; comms teams used runners (no phones) to avoid surveillance. The Oceti Sakowin Camp established protocols for who could enter different zones, how to respond to police encroachment, and what to do if someone was injured or arrested. This level of explicit safety planning allowed a movement to sustain itself for months in an openly hostile environment. Corporate security teams studying Standing Rock noticed that safety planning was actually what enabled *more* direct action, not less.

**Tech workers in climate direct action (2021–2023).** Engineers joining XR and climate strikes faced particular risks: employer retaliation, doxxing, and surveillance. Tech-savvy organisers created safety protocols specific to this context: secure devices policies (burner phones, VPNs), pre-action OpSec briefings about what not to post, agreements about employer confidentiality, and rapid-response support if someone was identified publicly. One group in the UK explicitly trained participants to spot undercover cops (a tech skill—recognising patterns in phone metadata or infiltrator behaviour). Safety planning here wasn't just about arrest; it was about protecting people's livelihoods. Participation became possible for people who would otherwise be too exposed.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age of real-time surveillance, AI-powered crowd analysis, and digital tracing, safety planning now requires a parallel digital architecture. AI systems can identify individuals in crowds from gait analysis and facial recognition. Corporate security uses these tools to threat-model activist events. Government agencies deploy them operationally. This changes the safety plan's surface.

Activist groups now embed tech practitioners into safety planning from the start: *How do we communicate without creating a data trail? How do we spot when AI-enabled surveillance is active? What patterns of behaviour might trigger algorithmic flags?* This is no longer paranoia—it's operational reality. A group planning direct action must have someone who understands digital hygiene alongside someone who understands police tactics.

The tech context translation becomes critical: Engineers in activist contexts must help the group think through device security (Signal not SMS), temporary identities (avoid using real names in online coordination), and counter-surveillance (recognise when location data is being harvested). Some groups now deploy their own AI—using computer vision to scan video footage for plainclothes operators, or network analysis to detect infiltrators by communication pattern anomalies.

This introduces new risks: over-reliance on opaque tech systems, false confidence in encrypted channels, the risk that the group becomes so focused on digital security that it neglects physical safety. It also creates new leverage: groups can crowdsource threat detection and real-time information flows at scale. A protest safety network can now aggregate police movement data across a city in minutes.

The pattern must evolve: safety planning now means explicit protocols for *when to trust digital systems and when to fall back to analog*—hand signals, face-to-face briefings, paper-based contingency plans—because digital systems can be infiltrated, jammed, or weaponised.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

- Participants return for a second action. They bring friends. The group's bench deepens because people don't feel shattered afterward.
- Role-holders proactively update safety protocols after each action based on what actually happened. The plan evolves, not fossilises.
- New participants ask good questions ("What's the arrest procedure?" "Where's the medic?") in the pre-action briefing, showing they've absorbed the culture that safety is normal and expected.
- When something goes wrong (an arrest, an injury), the group's response is coordinated, not chaotic. People know their jobs and stay focused.

**Signs of decay:**

- The safety briefing is rushed or skipped because "everyone knows this already." People arrive not knowing basic signals or role structures.
- Role-holders are the same people every time, and they're burned out. De-escalators aren't trained; medics don't have supplies. The structure becomes hollow.
- After an action where someone was arrested or injured, there's no debrief, no reflection, no update to the safety plan. The group repeats the same gaps.
- New participants feel patronised by "over-planning" or complain that safety planning kills spontaneity. This signals the group hasn't integrated the pattern—it's being imposed, not inhabited.

**When to replant:**

Restart or redesign this practice when you notice the group has grown past the scale of the original plan, or when a new major threat vector emerges (surveillance tech, new police tactics, new participants with different vulnerabilities). The right moment is *before* the next action, in a dedicated 2–3 hour session, not as an afterthought. The pattern survives by renewing its roots each season, not by relying on last year's map.
