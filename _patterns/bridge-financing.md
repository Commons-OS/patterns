# FF006: Bridge Financing

### 1. Overview

Bridge financing is a form of short-term funding used by companies to “bridge” a gap between major financing rounds or until a specific financial milestone is reached. Its core purpose is to provide immediate, temporary capital to sustain operations, fuel growth, or address urgent financial needs when longer-term funding is not yet available. This type of financing is particularly common in the startup ecosystem, where it solves the critical cash flow gap that can occur when a company is on the verge of a significant value inflection point but is not yet in a position to raise a full new round.

The concept of bridge financing has its roots in traditional corporate finance, but its application in the startup world has evolved significantly. Initially viewed negatively as a sign of distress, bridge financing is now also used strategically by healthy companies to accelerate growth or optimize the timing of their next funding round. The structure of these deals, often involving convertible notes or SAFEs, has been refined to be faster and more efficient than traditional equity financing.

In the context of commons-aligned value creation, bridge financing can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it provides a vital lifeline that can sustain a commons-oriented project that may have longer or less conventional paths to profitability, allowing it to survive and continue building its community and resources. It can offer the flexibility needed to navigate the complexities of building a shared resource without the immediate pressure to generate venture-scale returns. On the other hand, the terms of bridge financing, particularly if they come from traditional venture sources, can introduce pressures that conflict with commons principles. High interest rates, valuation caps, and the expectation of a near-term, high-multiple exit can push a commons-focused enterprise towards enclosure and extraction. Therefore, the alignment of bridge financing with commons principles depends heavily on the source of the capital and the structure of the deal. Sourcing bridge funds from community members, aligned impact investors, or through non-extractive revenue-based financing models can make it a powerful tool for supporting, rather than undermining, a commons-based approach.

### 2. Core Principles

1.  **Temporality and Immediacy:** The fundamental principle of bridge financing is its short-term nature. It is not a permanent capital solution but a temporary measure designed to address an immediate and well-defined funding gap. The expectation is that it will be replaced by a more substantial, long-term financing solution within a relatively short timeframe, typically 6 to 18 months.

2.  **Gap-Filling Function:** Bridge financing exists to fill a specific, identified gap. This could be a temporal gap (between priced rounds), a milestone gap (funding to reach a specific metric required for the next round), or an opportunity gap (capital to seize an unexpected growth opportunity). Its purpose is targeted and strategic, not general-purpose working capital in perpetuity.

3.  **Structural Flexibility:** Unlike standardized equity rounds, bridge financing is often structured for speed and flexibility. Convertible instruments like convertible notes and SAFEs are common, deferring complex negotiations about valuation until the next priced round. This allows capital to be deployed quickly to address the immediate need, though it comes with its own set of complexities regarding conversion mechanics.

4.  **Risk-Return Asymmetry:** Bridge financing carries a unique risk profile. For investors, it can be risky if the company fails to secure the subsequent financing, potentially leaving the bridge investors with a defaulted loan or worthless equity. To compensate for this risk, bridge instruments often include favorable terms for the investors, such as a valuation cap or a discount on the price of the next round, offering the potential for significant upside if the company succeeds.

5.  **Insider-Led Participation:** Existing investors are typically the first port of call for a bridge round. They have a vested interest in the company's survival and success, and their participation can be a strong positive signal to the market. Their deep knowledge of the company also allows for faster due diligence and execution. However, reliance solely on insiders can also be a sign of weakness if new, external investors are unwilling to participate.

6.  **Signaling Sensitivity:** The act of raising a bridge round sends a signal to the market. It can be interpreted negatively (the company is struggling) or positively (the company is capitalizing on an opportunity). The narrative and justification for the bridge are critically important in shaping this perception and have a significant impact on the company's ability to raise future funding.

### 3. Key Practices

1.  **Clearly Define the Use of Funds:** Before seeking a bridge loan, the company must have a precise and compelling plan for how the capital will be used. This shouldn't be a generic request for 
more runway." Instead, it should be tied to specific, measurable milestones, such as "achieve $50k MRR," "launch version 2.0 of the platform," or "hire two senior engineers to complete the product." This demonstrates discipline and a clear path to the next financing event.

2.  **Build a Detailed Financial Model:** A credible financial model is essential. It should show the current burn rate, the impact of the new capital on the runway, and the key assumptions that underpin the plan to reach the next milestone. This model is the foundation of the narrative and provides investors with the confidence that the requested amount is appropriate and sufficient.

3.  **Structure with Convertible Instruments:** The most common practice for bridge rounds is to use convertible instruments like convertible notes or SAFEs. This avoids the need for a formal 409A valuation and simplifies the legal process, making the round faster and cheaper to close. The key terms to negotiate are the valuation cap, the discount rate, and the interest rate (for convertible notes).

4.  **Secure a Lead Investor:** Even in a bridge round, having a lead investor is crucial. This is typically one of the company’s major existing investors who helps set the terms and anchors the round. Their commitment provides social proof and makes it easier to bring other existing and new investors into the round.

5.  **Develop a Strong Narrative:** Founders must proactively manage the signaling risk associated with a bridge round. This requires a clear, confident, and transparent narrative. If the bridge is due to missed targets, it's important to own the mistakes, explain the lessons learned, and present a credible plan for correction. If it's to pursue an opportunity, the narrative should be exciting and backed by data.

6.  **Over-communicate with Existing Investors:** Keep existing investors informed well in advance of the need for a bridge. Surprising them with an urgent cash call is a red flag. Regular, transparent updates build trust and make them more likely to be supportive when the need for a bridge arises.

7.  **Set a Realistic Timeline and Amount:** Be realistic about how much capital is needed and how long it will take to reach the next milestone. It is often wise to raise slightly more than the model suggests to provide a buffer for unexpected delays or challenges. Running out of cash a second time after a bridge round is often a fatal error.



### 4. Implementation

Implementing a bridge financing round requires a structured approach. First, founders must determine the necessity and purpose of the bridge by conducting a rigorous internal assessment of the company’s financial position and runway. This involves updating the financial model to project cash flow and identifying the precise amount of capital needed to reach a specific, fundable milestone. Once the need is confirmed, the next step is to engage key existing investors to secure a lead who will help set the terms and anchor the round. The terms of the bridge, typically a convertible note or SAFE, are then negotiated with this lead investor, focusing on the valuation cap, discount, and interest rate.

With a lead investor and term sheet, the process moves to execution. Legal counsel drafts the financing documents, which are circulated to participating investors. A concise investor memo should articulate the reason for the bridge, use of funds, and key milestones. The closing can be done on a rolling basis, allowing the company to access capital as it’s committed. Consistent and transparent communication with all stakeholders is critical throughout this process.

For commons-aligned enterprises, the implementation process has additional layers of consideration. The source of capital is paramount. Instead of defaulting to traditional VCs, the enterprise should first explore funding from its own community, aligned impact investors, or foundations that understand and support its commons-based mission. The structure of the financing should also be carefully considered. A standard convertible note with a high valuation cap might still create an implicit expectation of a high-growth, extractive exit. Alternatives like revenue-based financing, where repayments are tied to a percentage of revenue, can be a much better fit, as they align the cost of capital with the actual growth of the enterprise without forcing an equity-based exit. Another example is to structure the bridge with terms that favor conversion into non-voting or preferred stock with limited liquidation preferences, protecting the governance and mission of the commons. The key is to ensure that the implementation of the bridge financing reinforces, rather than undermines, the core principles of the commons, even if it means a more creative and potentially more complex fundraising process.

### 5. 7 Pillars Assessment

| Pillar | Score (1-5) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | 3 | Bridge financing is purpose-agnostic; it can be used to sustain a commons-oriented project or to fuel a purely extractive one. Its alignment depends entirely on the underlying purpose of the enterprise using it. |
| Governance | 2 | Traditional bridge financing, especially from VCs, can negatively impact governance by introducing investors with strong expectations for financial returns, potentially overriding community-centric decision-making. |
| Culture | 3 | The act of taking on bridge financing can shift the internal culture towards a more short-term, milestone-driven focus, which can be at odds with the patient, long-term perspective often required for building a commons. |
| Incentives | 2 | The incentives in a typical bridge round (valuation caps, discounts) are designed to reward a fast, high-valuation exit, which is often misaligned with the goal of creating and stewarding a shared resource for the long term. |
| Knowledge | 4 | Bridge financing does not inherently restrict knowledge sharing. However, if it pushes a company towards a more competitive, proprietary stance to maximize valuation, it can indirectly lead to the enclosure of knowledge. |
| Technology | 4 | Similar to knowledge, the technology itself is not directly impacted. The financing terms, however, could influence decisions about open-sourcing technology versus keeping it proprietary. |
| Resilience | 4 | When used correctly, bridge financing can be a powerful tool for resilience, providing the necessary capital to survive a difficult period and reach a more stable financial footing. It enhances short-term resilience. |
| **Overall** | **3.1** | **Bridge financing is a neutral tool that can be either helpful or harmful to a commons-aligned enterprise. Its impact is highly dependent on the source of capital and the specific terms of the deal. While it can provide critical life support, it also carries significant risks of misalignment with commons principles, particularly around governance and incentives.** |

### 6. When to Use

*   **To survive a cash crunch between priced rounds:** This is the classic use case, where a company is running out of money but has a clear line of sight to a fundable milestone for a Series A or B.
*   **To accelerate growth and hit key milestones:** A company may be performing well but could achieve a significantly higher valuation in its next round by hitting a specific, near-term milestone (e.g., reaching a certain revenue target, launching a new product). A bridge can provide the capital to get there.
*   **To capitalize on an unexpected opportunity:** A sudden market opening, a potential strategic partnership, or a chance to acquire a smaller competitor might require capital that is not in the current budget. A bridge can allow the company to seize the opportunity quickly.
*   **To extend runway during a difficult fundraising environment:** When the broader venture market is tight, it may be prudent to raise a small bridge round to extend the company’s runway, giving it more time to navigate the challenging market and secure a priced round on better terms.
*   **To prepare for a major event like an IPO or acquisition:** Late-stage companies may use a bridge to shore up their balance sheet and cover the significant costs associated with preparing for an initial public offering or to provide operating capital while an M&A process is underway.
*   **For commons-aligned projects needing flexible, patient capital:** When sourced from aligned investors, a bridge can provide the breathing room needed to build a community or a shared resource without the immediate pressure for venture-scale returns.

### 7. Anti-Patterns and Gotchas

*   **The “Bridge to Nowhere”:** Raising a bridge without a credible, achievable plan to reach the next fundable milestone. This often happens when founders are overly optimistic or not intellectually honest about the state of the business. It just delays the inevitable failure.
*   **Toxic Terms:** Accepting bridge financing with aggressive terms, such as a very low valuation cap, multiple liquidation preferences, or warrants that cause excessive dilution. This can cripple the company’s cap table and make it very difficult to raise future rounds.
*   **The “Party Round” Bridge:** A bridge round raised from a large number of small, unaligned investors with no clear lead. This can create a messy cap table and a governance nightmare, with no strong partner to help guide the company.
*   **Ignoring the Signaling Risk:** Failing to manage the narrative around the bridge round. If the market perceives it as a sign of desperation, it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, making it harder to attract customers, talent, and future investors.
*   **Multiple Bridge Rounds:** Raising a second or third bridge round is a major red flag. It indicates a persistent failure to hit milestones and an inability to attract institutional, priced-round funding. The terms of subsequent bridges often become increasingly punitive.
*   **Using a Bridge to Fund a Pivot:** While sometimes necessary, funding a major strategic pivot with a bridge is very risky. Bridge investors are typically backing the existing plan to get to the next round, not a whole new, unproven business model. A pivot often requires a full, priced “re-founding” round.
