# GL047: Securities Compliance

### 1. Overview

Securities compliance is the legal framework of rules and regulations that govern the issuance and sale of securities. Its core purpose is to protect investors from fraud and ensure that they have access to sufficient and accurate information to make informed investment decisions. In the startup and business context, securities compliance is a critical consideration for any company seeking to raise capital from external sources. The process of issuing securities, which can include everything from traditional stock to newer instruments like Simple Agreements for Future Equity (SAFEs), is heavily regulated by government agencies to prevent market manipulation and protect the public interest. The primary governing body for securities in the United States is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which was established in the aftermath of the 1929 stock market crash to restore investor confidence in the capital markets. The SEC enforces the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which form the foundation of federal securities law in the U.S.

For startups, navigating the complexities of securities law can be a daunting task. The high costs and time-consuming nature of registering securities with the SEC can be a significant barrier to entry for early-stage companies. However, non-compliance can have severe consequences, including legal liability for the company and its founders, the potential for investors to rescind their investments, and even criminal penalties. To address this challenge, the SEC has created several exemptions that allow startups to raise capital without undergoing the full registration process. These exemptions, such as Regulation D, are designed to facilitate capital formation for smaller businesses while still providing a degree of investor protection. For commons-aligned organizations, which often prioritize community ownership and distributed governance, securities compliance takes on a special significance. These organizations must carefully structure their fundraising efforts to align with their values while still adhering to the legal requirements of securities law. This can involve exploring alternative financing models, such as cooperative ownership structures or community-based fundraising, that are designed to distribute ownership and control more broadly among stakeholders.

### 2. Core Principles

1.  **Investor Protection:** The fundamental principle of securities law is to protect investors from fraudulent and unfair practices in the securities markets. This is achieved through mandatory disclosure requirements, anti-fraud provisions, and the regulation of market participants.
2.  **Full and Fair Disclosure:** Issuers of securities are required to provide investors with complete and accurate information about their business, financial condition, and the risks associated with the investment. This enables investors to make informed decisions and reduces information asymmetry between issuers and investors.
3.  **Market Integrity:** Securities regulations are designed to promote fair and orderly markets by prohibiting manipulative and deceptive practices. This helps to maintain public confidence in the capital markets and ensures that prices are determined by supply and demand rather than artificial forces.
4.  **Capital Formation:** While investor protection is a primary goal, securities law also seeks to facilitate capital formation by providing a clear and predictable legal framework for raising capital. Exemptions from registration are a key part of this, as they allow smaller companies to access capital without incurring the high costs of a public offering.
5.  **Federal and State Partnership:** Securities regulation in the U.S. is a dual system, with both federal and state laws governing the issuance and sale of securities. While federal law often preempts state law, issuers must still be mindful of state-level requirements, known as "Blue Sky" laws.

### 3. Key Practices

1.  **Determine if You Are Issuing a Security:** The first step in securities compliance is to determine whether your fundraising activities involve the issuance of a security. The definition of a security is very broad and includes a wide range of instruments, so it is best to assume that any investment contract is a security.
2.  **Understand the Difference Between Federal and State Laws:** Familiarize yourself with the basic requirements of both federal and state securities laws. While some federal exemptions preempt state law, others do not, so it is important to understand the rules in each state where you plan to raise capital.
3.  **Choose the Right Exemption:** Carefully evaluate the available exemptions from registration to determine which one is the best fit for your company. The most common exemptions for startups are Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D.
4.  **Verify Investor Status:** If you are relying on an exemption that is limited to accredited investors, you must take reasonable steps to verify that all of your investors meet the required criteria. This may involve reviewing financial statements or other documentation.
5.  **File the Necessary Forms:** Even if you are exempt from registration, you will likely still need to file a notice with the SEC and with each state where you sell securities. The most common form is Form D, which is a brief notice that provides basic information about the offering.
6.  **Maintain Accurate Records:** Keep detailed records of all of your fundraising activities, including who you sold securities to, how much you raised, and which exemption you relied on. This will be essential if you are ever audited by the SEC or a state securities regulator.
7.  **Consult with Legal Counsel:** Securities law is a complex and highly specialized area of law. It is essential to consult with an experienced securities attorney to ensure that you are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

### 4. Implementation

Implementing a securities compliance program requires a systematic approach that begins long before you start soliciting investments. The first step is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the legal landscape and to identify the specific regulations that apply to your business. This involves conducting thorough research on both federal and state securities laws and consulting with legal experts who specialize in this area. Once you have a clear understanding of the rules, you can begin to develop a compliance strategy that is tailored to your company's specific needs and goals. This strategy should include a detailed plan for how you will structure your fundraising efforts, which exemptions you will rely on, and how you will ensure that you meet all of the requirements of those exemptions.

A key part of any securities compliance program is the development of robust internal controls and procedures. This includes creating a system for tracking all of your fundraising activities, verifying the status of your investors, and ensuring that all of your disclosures are accurate and complete. It is also important to educate your team about the importance of securities compliance and to create a culture of compliance within your organization. This can help to prevent inadvertent violations and to ensure that everyone in your company is working together to protect the interests of your investors. Finally, it is essential to regularly review and update your compliance program to ensure that it remains effective and up-to-date with the latest legal and regulatory developments.

### 5. 7 Pillars Assessment

| Pillar | Score (1-5) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | 4 | Securities compliance is essential for any organization that wants to raise capital from external sources, and it can be a powerful tool for promoting transparency and accountability. |
| Governance | 3 | While securities law is not a substitute for good governance, it can help to create a more level playing field between founders and investors. |
| Culture | 3 | A strong culture of compliance can help to build trust with investors and other stakeholders, but it can also create a more risk-averse and bureaucratic environment. |
| Incentives | 2 | Securities law is primarily focused on protecting investors, and it does not directly address the issue of how to create a more equitable distribution of ownership and control. |
| Knowledge | 4 | The disclosure requirements of securities law can be a valuable source of information for investors and other stakeholders, but the complexity of the law can also be a barrier to entry for those who are not experts in this area. |
| Technology | 3 | Technology can be a powerful tool for streamlining the compliance process, but it can also create new risks and challenges. |
| Resilience | 4 | A strong compliance program can help to protect a company from legal and financial risks, but it can also make it more difficult to adapt to changing market conditions. |
| **Overall** | **3.3** | **Securities compliance is a critical but often overlooked aspect of building a commons-aligned organization. While it can be a complex and challenging area to navigate, it is essential for any organization that wants to raise capital in a way that is both legal and ethical.** |

### 6. When to Use

*   When raising capital from external investors.
*   When issuing stock or other equity instruments to employees or advisors.
*   When creating a new investment fund or other investment vehicle.
*   When engaging in a merger, acquisition, or other change of control transaction.
*   When you are a commons-aligned enterprise that wants to ensure its fundraising practices are transparent and accountable to its community.

### 7. Anti-Patterns and Gotchas

*   **Ignoring securities laws altogether:** Many founders are not aware of their obligations under securities law and may inadvertently violate the law by issuing securities without complying with the applicable regulations.
*   **Assuming that an exemption applies when it does not:** The requirements for each exemption are very specific, and it is easy to make a mistake that could invalidate the exemption.
*   **Failing to verify investor status:** If you are relying on an exemption that is limited to accredited investors, you must take reasonable steps to verify that all of your investors meet the required criteria.
*   **Making false or misleading statements to investors:** The anti-fraud provisions of securities law apply to all sales of securities, regardless of whether they are registered or exempt. This means that you can be held liable for making false or misleading statements to investors, even if you have complied with all of the other requirements of the law.
*   **Failing to file the necessary forms:** Even if you are exempt from registration, you will likely still need to file a notice with the SEC and with each state where you sell securities.
