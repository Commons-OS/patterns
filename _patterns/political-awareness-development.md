Developing ability to perceive informal power structures, read political winds, and understand how decisions actually get made—separate from formal processes—enables influence and safety.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Organizational Politics.

### Section 1: Context

Commons-stewarding systems—whether corporate teams, government agencies, activist networks, or engineering collectives—operate in a dual reality. Formal structures (org charts, policy frameworks, decision processes) exist alongside informal networks where real influence flows through relationships, historical grievances, unspoken alliances, and tacit knowledge. In growing systems, this duality is generative: informal networks accelerate trust-building and adaptive response. In fragmenting systems, the gap widens into cynicism and paralysis—people follow formal process while knowing decisions happen elsewhere. Government workers see this acutely: a policy approved through proper channels dies silently because a key stakeholder never bought in. Activist organizers watch movements fracture when factions form around unacknowledged power centers rather than transparent disagreement. Tech engineering leaders navigate both technical merit systems and influence hierarchies that determine whose architectural vision shapes the codebase. Corporate professionals oscillate between respecting hierarchy and understanding which senior leader's real sponsor matters more than title. The system's vitality depends on practitioners who can read both maps simultaneously—neither dismissing formal process as theatre nor pretending informal networks don't matter.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Political vs. Development.**

Development work—building capacity, scaling systems, creating value—depends on clarity, shared purpose, and forward momentum. It requires people to invest energy beyond their formal role. Political awareness requires attention to power, self-protection, and sideways movement. On the surface, these feel opposed: one looks naive (development), one looks cynical (political).

The real tension is this: Without political awareness, well-designed initiatives collapse because they threaten unacknowledged power holders. A commons steward designs elegant governance structures that flatten hierarchy, then watches them sabotaged by someone with informal veto power who never consented. A government reformer launches participatory budgeting only to discover a long-standing faction feels threatened by the visibility it creates. An activist leader builds inclusive decision-making, unaware that informal gatekeepers control which voices actually reach the table.

Conversely, pure political maneuvering hollows systems. Energy flows into coalition-building and threat-mitigation rather than value creation. The commons becomes a power-trading game. People learn to hide initiatives until political cover is secured. Trust erodes because visible decisions contradict informal ones.

The pattern breaks when practitioners operate blind to one reality or the other. Political blindness means repeated strategic failure. Political obsession means the system stops developing—it just reproduces existing power. The tension resolves only when someone develops genuine dual vision: reading the informal architecture while maintaining genuine commitment to shared purpose.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, build regular practices of structured political mapping that name informal power structures without colonizing all action to political logic.**

This pattern works because it creates a discontinuous shift in the nervous system of the commons. Instead of individuals managing political awareness privately (through gossip, rumor, or paranoia), the group develops shared, explicit maps of informal influence. This does three things simultaneously.

First, it reduces energy waste on political prediction and protection. When a team explicitly maps "who influences whom, who might block change, who holds veto power," members stop burning cognitive cycles on speculation. The anxiety itself diminishes because uncertainty converts to information. This is a roots-and-soil shift: the system can invest that freed energy in actual value creation rather than defensive positioning.

Second, it prevents the pathology where informal power becomes invisible and therefore absolute. Unnameable power ossifies into mythology—"the way things really work." Once named, it becomes subject to renegotiation. A tech team that maps "the principal engineer has architectural veto even though decisions are supposedly collaborative" can now have an actual conversation about whether that arrangement serves the system's growth. This doesn't eliminate the power holder's influence; it makes the influence legitimate or contested, not hidden.

Third, it maintains dual consciousness without forcing false choice between political realism and development commitment. Practitioners develop what organizational politics scholars call "both-and" awareness: I see the informal power structure AND I'm building toward something different. This is the living systems pattern of grafting—maintaining the existing root system while growing new tissue. The consciousness doesn't make someone cynical; it makes them strategic about development work in real political soil.

The source traditions in Organizational Politics distinguish between using power for self-protection (destructive) and using political awareness for system development (regenerative). This pattern supports the latter by making informal structures legible without mandating any particular response.

### Section 4: Implementation

Build political mapping as a structured, repeating practice—not a one-time analysis.

**Establish a political mapping rhythm.** Quarterly or biannually, gather the core stewardship circle (not the whole system—this is a practitioner skill-building container). Use a structured protocol: Map informal influence networks by asking three questions explicitly:
1. Who shapes decisions outside formal processes? (Name specific people and what domains they influence.)
2. Who has unspoken veto power—the people whose passive non-consent kills initiatives? (Distinguish between formal authority and informal blocking power.)
3. What historical events, grievances, or alliances explain current alignments? (The informal power structure is always rooted in story.)

Document findings in a shared (but private to the stewardship circle) map. Review it before major decisions or initiatives.

**In corporate contexts:** Engineering leads and product managers do this mapping before proposing org changes or technical direction shifts. Name the senior engineer who shapes tech culture despite lacking formal authority. Identify which executive sponsor's real opinion matters more than stated consensus. Knowing this prevents launching initiatives that look approved but will be starved of resources by someone with informal control over budgets or hiring.

**In government:** Policy designers map internal factions before implementation. Identify which civil servants have relationships with elected officials that transcend hierarchy. Name the constituency groups with informal veto—they might derail policy in practice even if officially approved. This prevents designing theoretically sound policy that fails operationally because informal gatekeepers never really consented.

**In activist networks:** Core organizers map power centers among movement factions before designing decision structures. Name which experienced organizers carry unacknowledged influence because of their history or relationship networks. Identify which constituencies feel threatened by visible process changes. This prevents building inclusive structures that accidentally centralize power among the people who understand the new system best.

**In tech engineering:** Leads map informal influence around technical decisions. Who actually shapes which technologies get adopted, even if decisions are supposedly merit-based? Which architects have followers despite lack of formal authority? Map this before proposing changes to development process or technical strategy.

After mapping, do a second move: **Design explicit accountability for informal power.** For each influence holder you mapped, ask: Is this power arrangement serving the commons development? Should it be formalized, renegotiated, or explicitly named as a constraint we're working within? This isn't about eliminating informal power—that's impossible and undesirable. It's about making it conscious and contestable. Some power arrangements should stay informal because they represent earned trust. Others should become formal (give someone actual authority rather than shadow authority). Some should be negotiated differently.

Don't hide the map. Share relevant political reality with people who need it to act effectively, but hold it in a container of psychological safety. If someone's informal veto power becomes gossip material, you've weaponized the pattern and it will collapse into pure politics.

**Couple mapping with commitment renewal.** The risk of political awareness is that it becomes cynicism. After mapping informal power, explicitly renew the group's commitment to the development work you're doing. What are we trying to build that's worth navigating this political reality? Why does the commons matter more than just winning power struggles? This prevents the pattern from hollowing into pure maneuvering.

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

New capacity emerges for strategic action that isn't blocked by invisible power. Initiatives fail less often from political ambush. The system develops what Argyris called "productive reasoning"—ability to think clearly about difficult realities without defensive distortion. Teams navigate change more fluidly because uncertainty about "who really matters" decreases. Relationship quality often improves paradoxically: once informal influence is named and negotiated rather than hidden, people can relate to each other more authentically. A tech lead can respect an informal architect's influence without resenting it. A government reformer can work with faction leaders without pretending divisions don't exist.

Trust in the commons itself strengthens because people see that the stewardship circle is reading reality accurately, not operating in denial about how power actually works.

**What risks emerge:**

The primary risk is that political mapping becomes routine without shifting actual behavior—a hollow practice that generates data without changing how decisions happen. This shows up as: people do the mapping exercise, file the findings, then proceed exactly as before, ignoring informal power structures. The practice becomes performative.

A secondary risk is weaponization: political maps become gossip, status hierarchies, or tools for excluding people. This happens when the practice leaks beyond its intended container or when stewards use mapped power to consolidate their own position rather than develop the commons.

The Resilience score of 3.0 reflects a real vulnerability: while political awareness prevents some failures, it doesn't create adaptive capacity. A system that's very good at reading informal power while innovation-poor will still ossify. This pattern maintains vitality but doesn't generate it. Watch for the practice becoming cynical or static—signs that practitioners have stopped believing in development work and are just managing politics. Also watch for the inverse: political denial creeping back in because the ongoing development work makes people want to believe in formal structures again.

The pattern also concentrates power in the people who do the mapping—the stewardship circle. It can inadvertently create a hidden elite with privileged information about how things really work.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Government agency redesign (US federal context):** A team redesigning citizen engagement processes discovered through political mapping that the official leadership coalition—the director and three division heads—masked a real power structure: two experienced civil servants who'd been in the agency for 20+ years held genuine veto power because they controlled relationships with key external constituencies and held institutional memory elected officials relied on. The redesign team had been trying to convince the formal leadership while the informal leaders remained unengaged. Once mapped and explicitly negotiated with, these civil servants became genuine partners in the redesign. The shift from trying to convince formal hierarchy to directly engaging informal power holders changed the initiative's trajectory from stalled to generative.

**Tech engineering culture change (large FAANG company):** An engineering director mapping informal influence discovered that promotion and hiring patterns correlated strongly with alignment to one principal engineer's technical philosophy, despite official commitment to "merit-based decisions." Once named, the company could choose whether to formalize that person's role as technical authority (making the power legitimate and bounded) or redistribute influence through structural changes. The mapping didn't solve the political tension, but it made it discussable rather than hidden. Teams stopped wasting energy wondering "why do certain ideas get funded" and could engage the actual conversation.

**Activist coalition organizing (environmental justice movement):** Coalition leaders mapped informal power among member organizations and discovered that three organizations—not the ones with stated governance authority—shaped which issues the coalition actually prioritized. This power came from having the most experienced organizers, deepest community relationships, and willingness to do unglamorous support work. Rather than pretend governance structures reflected actual influence, the coalition restructured to formalize these organizations' roles as core stewards while keeping them in conversation with broader membership. The transparency prevented simmering resentment and actually strengthened coalition coherence.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an era of distributed AI and networked commons, political awareness development shifts in character but gains strategic importance. AI systems now participate in informal influence networks: they're trained on data reflecting existing power structures, they're deployed by specific stakeholders with political interests, and they shape whose information reaches whom. Engineering leaders must now map not just human informal power but algorithmic influence—which models get built, whose values are embedded, which decisions AI systems actually make vs. which are attributed to them.

This creates new leverage: explicit political mapping can prevent AI systems from invisibly reproducing or amplifying existing power hierarchies. A government agency implementing an AI system for resource allocation must map who controls the training data, whose interests shaped the optimization function, and who will interpret the system's outputs. Without this mapping, AI often becomes a tool for automating existing political prejudices while claiming algorithmic objectivity.

The distributed commons era also introduces new political complexity: decisions now ripple across loosely-coupled networks where informal influence is harder to trace. A decision in one commons affects systems the stewards don't directly control. Political awareness must scale to understand networks of networks—not just mapping power within one group but understanding how informal influence flows across group boundaries.

The risk is acute: AI can make political invisibility automated and absolute. A system can efficiently reproduce power structures while all stakeholders believe they're being objective. Political awareness development becomes essential infrastructure, not optional sophistication. Practitioners need mapping practices that scale to algorithmic systems and cross-boundary networks.

The new edge case: teams that are politically sophisticated about human influence but treat technical/algorithmic systems as neutral. This is the new naivety. Mapping practices must now include questions about AI deployment, data sources, and technical decision-making that shapes commons operations.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

The pattern is working when stewards reference the political map explicitly before major decisions—"We need to bring the informal power holders into this conversation early." When practitioners can discuss informal influence without shame or cynicism ("This person has genuine authority in this domain, and that serves us well" or "This power arrangement is blocking innovation and we need to renegotiate it"). When people stop being surprised by how decisions actually happen. When informal power is negotiated openly rather than navigated through rumor and workaround. When initiatives still fail for good reasons (bad timing, resource constraints, genuine disagreement) but less often from hidden political sabotage.

**Signs of decay:**

The pattern is hollow when the mapping exercise happens but doesn't change behavior—stewards do the mapping, then proceed exactly as before. When people begin using political maps as gossip or status currency rather than strategic information. When cynicism replaces strategic awareness ("Everything is just politics anyway, so why develop anything?"). When the practice becomes concentrated in a hidden stewardship elite, creating an invisible second government. When practitioners stop genuinely believing in the development work and treat political maneuvering as the only real game. When newly mapped informal power holders use their visibility to consolidate position rather than to enable commons development.

**When to replant:**

Restart the practice if stewards notice decisions consistently failing from political blindness—same pattern repeating despite good design. Or if the practice has become routine and people treat the map as static truth rather than as evolving reality. Political structures shift; maps grow obsolete. Replant when you notice practitioners defaulting back to political denial or when a significant change occurs in the commons (new members joining, external pressure shifting, leadership transitions)—these moments require fresh mapping before old political patterns solidify around new conditions.
