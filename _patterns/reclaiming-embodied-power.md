title: "Reclaiming Embodied Power"
aliases: []
summary: >-
  Many people, especially those with trauma or cultural conditioning,
  have disconnected from bodily power. The pattern is gradually
  reclaiming relationship with embodied power: feeling your capacity,
  noticing strength, standing in your physical presence, resisting
  cultural conditioning (especially gendered) about how you should
  take up space. This involves somatic practices (martial arts, dance,
  yoga), voice work, and psychological integration. Embodied power is
  different from aggression; it's grounded presence and capacity. Many
  commons movements need this reclaimed power.

Many people, especially those with trauma or cultural conditioning, have disconnected from bodily power—and reclaiming that grounded presence and capacity is essential for co-owned commons work.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Staci Haines on embodied power and Somatic Experiencing.

### Section 1: Context

Commons movements face a particular fragility: they ask people to show up with agency, to hold boundaries, to negotiate shared power—yet many participants arrive depleted, contracted, or dissociated from their own capacity. This is not psychological weakness; it is the predictable outcome of trauma, gendered conditioning, economic precarity, and systemic messages that certain bodies (especially women, people of color, disabled people, working-class people) should occupy less space and assert less presence.

The ecosystem breaks down when coordinators, stewards, and members cannot feel their own power. Decisions become either passive (deferring to charismatic figures) or aggressive (mimicking extraction hierarchies). Governance stalls. Relationships fray because people lack the somatic ground to negotiate honestly. In corporate settings, this manifests as performative inclusion without real voice. In government, it locks public servants into rigid roles. In activist movements, it reproduces the very hierarchies being resisted. In tech, it embeds power imbalances into product architecture itself.

The pattern emerges from the recognition that embodied power—grounded presence, clear voice, physical confidence, capacity to take up space—is not aggression. It is the baseline health of a nervous system capable of collaborative work. Without it, commons cannot actually distribute power; they can only perform distribution.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Reclaiming vs. Power.**

One side of the tension says: *Power is dangerous. I was taught not to be powerful—not to take up space, not to raise my voice, not to trust my strength. That conditioning protected me.* This side holds legitimate caution about domination and harm.

The other side says: *I cannot do work that matters without feeling my own capacity. I cannot negotiate fairly if I am contracted. I cannot co-own anything if I do not trust my presence.* This side recognizes that powerlessness is not safety; it is vulnerability to exploitation.

The conflict is not resolved by choosing one side. When people remain disconnected from embodied power, commons movements inherit fragile governance: people cannot say no clearly, cannot hold boundaries, cannot detect when they are being colonized by old hierarchies. Voice becomes either apologetic or dominating, with no middle ground. Decisions get made by whoever can tolerate the most discomfort in the room—often those with the least conditioning against power.

When the tension is unresolved, the system loses adaptive capacity. Newcomers arrive without models of what grounded presence looks like. Conflicts escalate because people lack the somatic tools to stay present during disagreement. Leadership roles remain concentrated because distribution requires more embodied confidence than the system can generate. The commons becomes brittle, dependent on a few people who somehow retained or recovered their power.

The real stake: can people actually choose participation, or are they choosing based on nervous system contraction?

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, create conditions for people to gradually feel their capacity, notice their strength, stand in physical presence, and integrate that reclaimed power into the daily work of the commons.**

This is not transformation through belief or ideology. It is cultivation through practice—somatic, repetitive, grounded in the body's own intelligence.

The mechanism works because the nervous system learns through experience, not instruction. When someone practices martial arts and feels their own force move through space, when they sing and feel vibration in their chest, when they dance and experience their weight as grounded rather than burdensome—something shifts that no amount of intellectual work can touch. The body recognizes: *I have capacity. My presence is not aggression. I can hold space.*

This reclamation is not about aggressive dominance. Embodied power in the commons context means: clarity without cruelty, presence without control, voice without volume, boundaries without walls. It is the nervous system of someone who can stay present with difficulty, who can say no without disappearing, who can listen without losing themselves.

The source traditions—Staci Haines' somatic justice work and Somatic Experiencing (SE)—teach that power is stored in the body. Trauma and conditioning suppress that power by creating held tension, dissociation, or collapse. SE and body-based practices gradually restore the capacity to sense, to move, to be present. In commons work, this means people can actually participate in decision-making without unconsciously deferring or dominating.

The vitality shift is this: the system moves from performing distribution to actually distributing power. Coordination becomes possible because people have enough ground to negotiate. New participants see models of what embodied presence looks like and can begin their own reclamation. The commons becomes an environment that *sustains* people's vitality rather than consuming it.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

The practice unfolds in four parallel streams, each anchored in the body and integrated into the commons' actual work.

**First: Establish somatic anchor practices.** These are brief, regular embodied experiences that become part of how the commons gathers. Begin each meeting with three minutes of grounding: feet on floor, noticing weight, feeling the support beneath. Add voice work—a simple hum, a chant, a call-and-response—that lets people feel vibration in their sternum and throat. Rotate in practitioners (martial artists, yoga teachers, dance facilitators) who can offer monthly workshops where people experience their own capacity in a contained way. For *activist* contexts, this might be movement preparation before action—feeling your stance, your solidity, your clarity. For *government* contexts, it becomes a practice for public servants before difficult meetings: "I am here. My body is here. I can stay present." For *corporate* settings, integrate it into team time—even thirty seconds of conscious breathing before strategic decisions. For *tech* teams, this means: actual bodies in the room for crucial design decisions, not just Zooms. Feel where you are designing from.

**Second: Create explicit permission structures.** Many people need explicit, repeated permission to take up space. State it directly in governance documents: "Everyone in this commons has the right to be fully present, to speak clearly, to take up the space your body occupies." In *activist* movements, this means teaching people that strength is not domination—that a woman's loud voice is clarity, not aggression; that a disabled person's need for accommodation is legitimate power, not burden. In *government* organizations, it means protecting the right of frontline workers to speak difficult truths without retaliation. In *corporate* contexts, it means dismantling the policing of tone ("you're being aggressive") that silences people, especially women and people of color. In *tech*, it means: whose bodies and voices are actually in the room when products are designed? Whose power is silenced by distributed, text-only collaboration?

**Third: Practice boundary-holding in low-stakes scenarios.** Embodied power requires repeated experience of saying no, holding a position, disagreeing without disappearing. Build this into commons practice: in decision-making, explicitly practice disagreement. Ask people to take positions—not to persuade, but to hold a viewpoint while others hold others. Notice: who stays present? Who collapses? Who becomes aggressive? Create psychological safety to notice these patterns without shame, then practice again. For *activists*, this is direct action training that includes learning to say no to inappropriate tactics. For *government*, it is staff meetings where dissenting voices are genuinely sought and protected. For *corporate*, it is design reviews where junior people can actually object to senior decisions without career risk. For *tech*, it is code reviews and decision logs where disagreement is visible, named, and resolved through presence rather than hierarchy.

**Fourth: Integrate power reclamation into the commons' actual work.** Do not silo this as "wellness" or "personal development." Embody it in governance. Rotate facilitation and coordination roles so people practice holding power in real scenarios, not in workshops. When someone noticeably steps into more presence, name it: "I notice you spoke more clearly in that decision. What changed?" Create mentoring relationships where someone with reclaimed power works alongside someone still contracting. For *activists*, this means older organizers explicitly teaching younger people how to stand, breathe, and speak in their power. For *government* bodies, it means senior leaders modeling what it looks like to change your mind, to hold uncertainty, to stay present with disagreement. For *corporate* teams, it means managers who ask: "Are you actually here in this meeting, or are you performing?" For *tech*, it means design sprints that include the bodies and voices of those most affected by the product—and the power dynamics to actually listen.

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

New coherence emerges between what people say and how they say it. Decisions move faster because people are present enough to know their actual position. Newcomers arrive and immediately sense a different environment—one where bodies matter, where presence is valued, where power is not hoarded. The commons develops real resilience because distribution of power becomes possible; people can actually step into roles and step back out without the role becoming their identity. Conflict changes texture: disagreements become clearer, sharper, more navigable because people are not managing their own contraction while also managing the problem. Communities report that participation becomes sustainable—less emotional exhaustion, more aliveness. The aesthetic changes: you can see it in how people stand, how they speak, how they listen.

**What risks emerge:**

The most acute risk is performative embodiment—people learning the *appearance* of power without the nervous system integration. This creates a new form of hierarchy where those who are already confident claim somatic practice as their identity, and the actually vulnerable are left behind. Watch especially for this in *corporate* contexts, where embodiment language gets co-opted into "confident leadership" stripped of its justice dimensions.

Because resilience scores are 3.0, the pattern is vulnerable to routinization. If somatic practice becomes obligatory, if the commons requires people to perform confidence, if the culture of "embodied power" becomes as constrictive as the old culture of silence—the pattern has decayed into its opposite. The early openness hardens into new conformity.

There is also the risk of retraumatization. Not everyone's path to embodied power looks the same. Pushing certain practices (particularly those involving physical contact or vulnerability) without deep consent and option-building can harm people still in active healing. The pattern works best when it is offered as genuine choice, not requirement.

---

### Section 6: Known Uses

**The Ruckus Society's Direct Action Training (Activist context).** For decades, Ruckus has taught organizers that their bodies are their first tool. Before anyone participates in civil disobedience or direct action, they practice standing in their power, learning to breathe under pressure, feeling the ground beneath their feet. Participants report that this somatic foundation changes what they can actually do in the streets. They can stay present during arrest, can hold formation, can make clear decisions under stress. The pattern is embedded in their pre-action trainings: you do not just learn tactics; you learn to inhabit your own capacity. This is why Ruckus-trained movements show different resilience—people do not burn out as quickly because they are not running on adrenaline and dissociation; they are running on genuine ground.

**Staci Haines' Generative Somatics and the Movement for Black Lives (Activist context).** Haines explicitly teaches that embodied power is central to liberation. In Generative Somatics programs with organizers of color, the work is: reclaim the power that was taught out of you, that was colonized, that was criminalized in your body. The practice includes martial arts, voice work, and intimate group process. Organizers who come through this training report that they can actually hold themselves in power while fighting systems designed to diminish them. The pattern has influenced dozens of organizations, from Movement Strategy Center to local Black-led organizations, because it addresses the specific somatic work required of people whose bodies have been targets.

**Government Service Leadership Programs integrating Somatic Experiencing (Government context).** Several state and local government programs have begun bringing somatic practitioners into leadership development for public servants. The recognition: officials who can feel their own ground can make decisions that serve communities, not just execute mandates. A specific case: a city council member trained in somatic awareness began visibly changing how they held meetings. They could tolerate dissent without defensiveness. They could ask genuine questions instead of rhetorical ones. They could stay present when criticized. Over two years, the council's decision-making shifted toward genuine deliberation. The pattern is subtle but observable: better decisions, less performative governance, more actual listening.

---

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age where intelligence is increasingly distributed across networks, AI systems, and virtual spaces, embodied power becomes both more urgent and more threatened. Here is what shifts:

Many commons now exist primarily in digital space—Slack channels, shared documents, video calls. The body becomes invisible, and with it, the somatic ground that embodied power requires. A person can be fully present in a room but dissociated on Zoom. The pattern must adapt: How do we cultivate embodied power in distributed systems? Some answers emerging: requiring video on, building in movement breaks, creating hybrid models where key decisions happen in physical space. For *tech* product teams, this means: your distributed teams are making decisions about embodied experience (how people move, feel, inhabit digital space) from a place of dissociation. This is why so many digital products feel extractive and depleting. The pattern says: bring bodies back. Make design decisions in the room. Feel the product in your body before you scale it.

AI introduces a new risk: the outsourcing of presence. When algorithms make decisions, when chatbots handle conflict, when recommendation systems shape what we see—the need for human embodied power actually increases, not decreases. But the cultural pressure moves the opposite direction: let the system decide, let the algorithm be neutral, trust the network. This erodes the ground for embodied power reclamation. The commons pattern must become more explicit: We choose human presence. We choose bodies in the room for decisions that matter. We distrust any system that asks us to surrender our embodied judgment.

There is also new leverage: AI can surface patterns of who is actually speaking, whose ideas are centered, whose silence is being rewarded. Data can show: are we actually distributing power, or performing it? Are women's voices actually heard or just recorded? This feedback loop can accelerate the pattern—making invisible power dynamics visible, creating pressure to actually integrate embodied power.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

The commons visibly changes its physical ecology. People stand differently in meetings—weight forward, occupying the chair rather than perching. Voices carry more. Silence becomes rich rather than anxious. In decision moments, you see genuine deliberation: people actually disagree and stay present. The pattern is working when newcomers arrive and immediately sense permission to be here—when they do not have to shrink. Relatedly, people report feeling less exhausted after participation, not more. The work asks something from them, but does not extract their aliveness. Finally, when conflict emerges (and it will), people navigate it with less drama because they can feel their own ground and sense others' ground. Disagreement becomes clarifying rather than destabilizing.

**Signs of decay:**

The pattern has hollowed when embodiment becomes performance—people have learned the language and gestures of power but remain contracted underneath. Confidence becomes a mask. Watch for: people who speak strongly but whose nervous system signals collapse (shaking hands, shallow breath, words faster than presence). The pattern has also decayed when it becomes exclusive: only certain people (the "naturally confident," the trained, the already privileged) are seen as embodied, while others are positioned as needing to "fix themselves" before they can participate fully. This recreates hierarchy. Another clear sign of decay: the commons stops noticing that people are dissociated. It accepts silence as choice, contracts as personality, absence as introversion. The pattern survives only if the culture actively sees and names what is real.

**When to replant:**

Replant when you notice the pattern has become routinized—when grounding practice becomes obligatory check-in rather than genuine cultivation. Return to the source: bring in new facilitators, change the practice, let it surprise people again. Also replant when you notice the commons has absorbed new members who have not done this work; the culture of embodied power is fragile and requires consistent tending. The right moment to replant is when you feel the system beginning to contract again—when decisions start reverting to invisible hierarchies, when people's voices dim. That is the signal: ground again.
