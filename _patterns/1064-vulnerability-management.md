### 1. Overview

Vulnerability Management is a pattern for building resilient value creation systems.

**Problem:** Software vulnerabilities are discovered every day. If you are not systematically looking for them in your own systems, you can be sure that attackers are. An unpatched vulnerability is an open door for an attacker. A reactive, ad-hoc approach to patching is not enough to keep up with the constant stream of new threats.

**Context:** You are responsible for the security of a portfolio of applications and infrastructure. You need a systematic and continuous process for identifying, prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities.

### 2. Core Principles

**Establish a formal Vulnerability Management program, a continuous cycle of identifying, assessing, reporting on, and remediating vulnerabilities across your environment.**

The key stages of a vulnerability management lifecycle are:
1.  **Discover**: Continuously scan your environment to create an inventory of all your assets and to identify vulnerabilities in them. This includes using:
    -   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)** to find vulnerabilities in your open-source dependencies.
    -   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** to find vulnerabilities in your own code.
    -   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)** to find vulnerabilities in your running applications.
    -   **Infrastructure Scanning** to find vulnerabilities in your operating systems and other infrastructure components.
2.  **Prioritize**: Assess the risk of each vulnerability based on its severity (e.g., using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System, or CVSS), the business criticality of the affected asset, and whether it is being actively exploited in the wild. This allows you to focus your remediation efforts on the most important risks.
3.  **Remediate**: Fix the vulnerability, typically by applying a patch, updating a library, or changing a configuration.
4.  **Verify**: Scan the asset again to verify that the vulnerability has been successfully remediated.

### 3. Rationale

A formal Vulnerability Management program is a foundational practice for cybersecurity hygiene. It:
- **Reduces Your Attack Surface**: Systematically reduces the number of open doors for attackers.
- **Provides a Prioritized View of Risk**: Allows you to focus your limited resources on the most important threats.
- **Is a Compliance Requirement**: It is a requirement for many security standards and regulations (like PCI DSS and HIPAA).

### 4. Consequences

- **Positive**:
    - A significant reduction in your organization's risk exposure.
    - A more proactive and systematic approach to security.
- **Negative**:
    - **Can be a lot of work**: A large organization can have tens of thousands of vulnerabilities. It requires a dedicated team and a mature process to manage them effectively.
    - **Friction with development teams**: The need to patch vulnerabilities can sometimes conflict with the need to deliver new features. It is important to have a good working relationship between the security and development teams.

### 5. Application Context

**Best Used For:**
* Value creation systems requiring strong privacy and security foundations
* Organizations operating in regulated environments
* Systems handling sensitive data or requiring high trust

### 6. Known Uses

- **This is a standard and essential practice** for any organization that is serious about security.
- **Many commercial and open-source tools** are available to support vulnerability management programs (e.g., Qualys, Tenable, OpenVAS).
