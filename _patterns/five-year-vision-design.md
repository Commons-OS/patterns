A detailed five-year vision—what you're doing, where you're living, relationships, accomplishments—provides medium-term direction and decision filter.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Long-Term Planning.

### Section 1: Context

Most living commons systems exist in a temporal fog: reactive to urgent pressures, blind to their own drift. Teams ship quarterly. Movements chase campaigns. Networks form around immediate need and dissolve when intensity wanes. Yet the ecosystem itself doesn't operate on quarter-year cycles—it grows, relationships mature, capacity deepens, and structural decay begins unfolding across years.

Five-year vision design emerges when a steward, team, or movement realizes that the gap between *what they want to create* and *what they're actually building* has become invisible. Without a medium-term horizon, systems tend toward two pathologies: either they accumulate decision-debt (saying yes to everything until the system collapses), or they calcify (repeating last year's strategy because no one articulated a better direction).

This pattern is particularly alive in contexts where interdependence is growing—where your decisions affect others' capacity over time. Corporate teams executing multi-phase product lines feel it. Government officials stewarding institutions through administration cycles live it. Activist movements trying to sustain pressure across years need it urgently. Engineers building infrastructure know it viscerally: technology compounds, and directional clarity becomes exponentially more valuable as system complexity increases.

The pattern works because it names a rhythm that matches how actual capacity emerges: slower than sprints, faster than generational change.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Five vs. Design.**

"Five"—a specific, bounded, medium-term horizon—pulls toward commitment, measurable milestones, and accountability. It says: *by this date, this will be different*. It creates pressure. It requires sacrifice and focus. Five-year commitments mean you *don't* do other things.

"Design"—the creation of intentional, detailed structure—pulls toward richness, nuance, and responsiveness. It says: *account for relationships, context, constraints, and what we actually care about*. True design is never rushed. It requires conversation, iteration, and the willingness to be wrong before you're right.

The tension breaks systems two ways:

**When Five dominates:** Teams lock into rigid roadmaps that ignore changing conditions. Leaders become brittle, defending outdated plans. New people absorb doctrine instead of understanding intention. The vision becomes a cage. Stakeholders withdraw because the system has become predictable and closed to their input. The five-year plan becomes a five-year prison.

**When Design dominates:** Conversations spiral into philosophical rabbitholes. Visions stay perpetually conceptual. Nothing crystallizes into actual commitment. Teams drift. Relationships between people working on the same system become uncertain. After five years, you realize you haven't actually done anything differently than you did five years ago, just with better language.

The real sting comes when they collide: a beautifully designed vision that no one can remember, or a committed plan that no one cares about because it never accounted for what actually matters to them. Both states kill vitality—one through brittleness, one through diffusion.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, write a detailed five-year vision together through a structured design process, translating lived values into specific, sensory descriptions of accomplishment, relationship, location, and daily practice—then use that vision as a living decision filter, not a prediction.**

The mechanism here is translation across scales. A five-year vision bridges the gap between abstract values ("we care about resilience") and immediate choices ("should we hire this person? Fund this project? Move to this location?"). It does this through *specificity and sensuousness*.

When a steward or team can articulate not just *what* they'll accomplish but *where they'll be, who they'll be with, what their daily work will feel like, what relationships will have deepened*—the vision becomes a living root system rather than a floating idea. The practitioner can test real decisions against it: *Does this opportunity move us toward that vision of 2029, or away from it?* The answer is often immediately clear.

The design process itself—the collaborative making of the vision—is as vital as the artifact. In living systems terms, roots must grow downward together; they can't be installed. When a core team or co-ownership body *designs* a five-year vision together, several things happen:

- **Unstated assumptions surface.** What one person imagines as "thriving" differs from another. Better to discover that disagreement now, in vision-design, than to discover it three years in when people are burnt out.
- **Ownership grows.** A vision you helped write isn't something imposed on you; it's something you chose. Your hand is in it. Your future is in it.
- **Capacity for adaptation emerges.** Because the vision names *why* (the values), not just *what* (the deliverables), teams can pivot the *how* when conditions demand it and still stay true to direction.

The vision acts as a *filter*, not a forecast. You're not predicting the future; you're naming what kind of future you're moving toward, then filtering decisions through it. This is how the pattern generates resilience—it gives the system a spine without locking it into a skeleton.

### Section 4: Implementation

**Step 1: Convene the stewardship circle.** 

This is not a work-session with whoever has bandwidth this week. Bring the people with the most skin in the game—those who will *live* the consequences of this vision. In corporate contexts, this means founders or C-level folks who set portfolio strategy; in government, the officials who will serve under this vision; in activist movements, the core organizers who show up in hard seasons; in engineering, the architects who carry system intent across years. (4–8 people is typical; larger circles fragment.)

**Step 2: Harvest values, constraints, and non-negotiables.**

Before you write the vision, surface what matters. Spend 2–3 hours in conversation mapping: *What do we never want to compromise on?* *What conditions must exist for us to do good work?* *What relationships are non-negotiable?* *Where do we need to be, physically or geographically, for this work to be real?* Document these raw. Don't synthesize yet.

**Step 3: Draft the vision together in sensory, specific language.**

Each person writes a 2–3 page private draft describing their vision of "us" in five years. What are you *doing*? Name specific work. What does your week look like? Where are you living or spending time? Who are you in relationship with—name people or roles. What's something you're proud of? What's something that surprised you about how it all unfolded? What do people say about you or your work?

The specificity matters. Not "we serve more clients" but "on Tuesday mornings, we're in the kitchen with 12 families from the neighborhood, testing a new recipe together." Not "we've grown" but "we hired Amara and James, and they brought entirely different thinking we didn't expect."

**Step 4: Synthesize in community.**

Read these drafts aloud to each other. Where do they overlap? Where do they diverge? Which phrases show up across multiple visions? Which tensions are real (a core conflict about scale, for instance) versus which are just different angles on the same thing?

Create a shared draft together—a 3–4 page vision that weaves the threads. It should feel true to the group even if no single person wrote exactly what they would have written alone. That compromise is the whole point: you're building shared ownership.

**Step 5: Translate into decision filters.**

Now make it actionable. Extract 5–7 specific questions that flow from this vision. These become your annual and quarterly decision filter:

- *Corporate example:* "Does this partnership move us toward a product people depend on for their livelihoods, or toward a convenience play? Our vision says the former."
- *Government example:* "Does this hiring decision bring in someone who shares our belief that this institution should serve the neighborhood's real needs, or are we just filling a slot? Check it against the vision."
- *Activist example:* "Are we doing this campaign because it builds local leadership in the four neighborhoods we committed to, or because a funder waved money at us? The vision says the former."
- *Tech example:* "This technical debt: does paying it now buy us the kind of system architecture we said we'd build, or are we solving for convenience? The vision guides us."

**Step 6: Live it for one year before the next refresh.**

Use the vision as a reference point in monthly team conversations, hiring decisions, partnership discussions, and resource allocation. Notice where it clarifies choice and where it goes vague. That feedback is gold. Don't rewrite it every quarter (that way lies drift), but do notice what's working and what's not.

---

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

New capacity emerges because clarity creates permission. When a team knows what five-year state they're moving toward, individual members can take initiative in alignment with it. You don't need permission to hire someone who fits the vision; you do it because it's aligned. Relationships deepen because people are in choice about *why* they're together, not just *what* they're executing. Decisions that used to require meetings and debate resolve faster because the vision acts as a spine. Over five years, this compounds: the system becomes more coherent, more responsive, and more able to adapt when external conditions shift—because people understand *why* they're doing what they're doing, not just *what*.

Decision-debt decreases. Teams that don't have a shared five-year vision tend to accumulate "yes" after "yes" until the system breaks. With a clear vision, you have a legitimate reason to say no: *This doesn't move us toward the future we're building.* That's not meanness; it's stewardship. Saying no with clarity is actually a sign of health.

**What risks emerge:**

**Brittleness in the vision itself.** If the five-year vision becomes law, the system loses adaptability. It becomes the Five vs. Design problem all over again—you're locked into a plan that external reality has made obsolete. This happens when teams write the vision and then treat it as sacred, unchangeable truth. The pattern works only if the vision is *living*—revisited annually, adjusted when reality demands it, but held with commitment rather than dogma.

**Exclusion and false ownership.** If only executives write the vision and hand it down, mid-level practitioners and frontline workers absorb it as doctrine, not choice. Their ownership will be shallow. They'll execute the letter while the spirit drains away. In commons-based systems, this is poison. The consequence isn't just disengagement; it's a system that becomes brittle precisely because people aren't making real choices about it.

**Resilience below the surface (3.0 score).** This pattern is strong on *clarity and ownership*, but if the five-year vision doesn't build in explicit redundancy, distributed decision-making, or adaptation protocols, the system becomes fragile when keystone people leave or external conditions shift rapidly. A vision written by five executives that depends on those five people to interpret it in real-time is not resilient—it's centralized leadership with better language. The pattern needs to be paired with practices that distribute intelligence (not just clarity) throughout the system.

**Slow-moving systems can calcify.** Five years is appropriate for systems with moderate change velocity. For rapid-iteration tech teams or fast-moving activist networks, five years can feel like an eternity. The pattern works better when paired with shorter feedback loops (annual, quarterly) that keep the vision honest against reality.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Mondragon Corporation (co-operative federation, Spain, 1956–present):** The Mondragon cooperative federation has used multi-year vision cycles—not five, but sometimes seven or ten—as a core governance practice. Each cooperative drafts a vision of what it wants to be, including employment levels, product lines, geographic reach, and relationship to the broader federation. These visions are written through assemblies where worker-owners themselves articulate what kind of enterprise they want to work in. The practice has allowed Mondragon to survive three major economic crises (including the 2008 collapse) precisely because the system wasn't locked into a single growth-at-all-costs model. Different cooperatives had different five-to-seven-year visions, which created organizational redundancy. When one cooperative's market collapsed, others absorbed the workers or pivoted. The visions weren't predictions; they were direction statements that allowed rapid adaptation while holding to core values.

**Code for America (civic tech, US, 2011–present):** The organization uses a five-year vision design practice at the program level. Every two years, core teams designing a new civic tech program (say, helping cities improve permitting systems) spend two weeks in intensive vision design. They describe: *In five years, permitting will be reimagined in 50 American cities. What does that look like? How many staff do we have? What's the relationship between Code for America and city governments?* They write it with specificity: not "we have good partnerships" but "San Francisco and Oakland use the same permitting portal, and city staff asked us to help five more pairs of cities do it." This practice has allowed Code for America to stay focused across political cycles and funding volatility. When a particular federal administration changed and some funding disappeared, the five-year vision guided which programs to deepen and which to pause.

**Transition Towns movement (climate resilience, global, 2006–present):** Local Transition initiatives use a variant of this pattern: a "vision of a resilient future" written for their town, usually projected 15–20 years but broken into five-year checkpoints. In the English town of Totnes (where the movement started), residents worked together to articulate: *In five years, where is our energy coming from? How many people are growing food locally? What do our high streets look like?* The specificity—"the old supermarket lot is now a community market garden with 120 local growers; people walk or bike to it"—helped residents make real choices. A planning decision came up: approve a large-scale solar farm outside town, or refuse it in favor of distributed rooftop solar? The shared vision made the choice clear. The practice has been adopted by over 1,200 Transition Towns worldwide, and evaluation data shows that communities with written five-year visions are significantly more likely to follow through on resilience projects than those with vague aspirations.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an era of AI-driven forecasting and accelerating change, the Five Year Vision pattern faces both new hazards and new leverage.

**The hazard:** It's tempting to use AI to *predict* the five-year future with precision—to feed models your market data, organizational capacity, and growth curves and let them spit out a "realistic" trajectory. This inverts the pattern's real purpose. A five-year vision isn't a forecast you're trying to match; it's a direction-statement that helps you stay aligned when reality diverges from prediction. If you use AI to predict the future and then treat that prediction as gospel, you've just automated the brittleness problem.

**The leverage:** AI can help make the vision *more specific and testable*. An engineering team designing a five-year technical architecture can use AI to stress-test it: *Given these traffic patterns and this code-quality standard, will this architecture hold?* Activist networks can use AI to model five-year scenarios: *If we invest in leadership development in these neighborhoods, what knock-on effects cascade over five years?* The specificity improves. The catch: the *values* and *priorities*—the "why" of the vision—still come from humans in dialogue. AI can illuminate trade-offs, but it can't choose values.

**The new risk:** Networked AI systems can amplify groupthink in vision design. When a stewardship circle sits down to draft a five-year vision with AI assistance, there's a subtle pressure to converge on the "optimal" vision the AI surfaces. Diversity of vision—the tension that often generates wisdom in co-design—gets smoothed into consensus. The remedy is deliberate: use AI for stress-testing and scenario-generation, but protect the human process of *divergence and synthesis* from AI optimization.

**The edge case:** In tech teams specifically, five-year architecture visions are becoming more valuable, not less, precisely because systems are getting more complex. An engineer designing infrastructure needs not just a quarterly roadmap but a coherent vision of system architecture and decision-making patterns that will hold five years out. That clarity becomes the spine that allows rapid iteration *within* a coherent direction. The pattern fits here better than anywhere.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

- The vision is referenced in real decisions. In monthly team meetings, you hear: "Does this align with the vision we wrote?" and people disagree productively about what the vision implies. The vision is being *used*, not framed.
- New people absorb the vision quickly and begin making autonomous choices in alignment with it. They don't need to ask permission; the spine is clear enough that they can act.
- Annual reviews of the vision show *adjusted but continuous* direction. Some specifics have shifted—the market moved, a key person left, a new constraint emerged—but the core values and ambition haven't eroded. This is health, not drift.
- Stakeholders (team members, partners, customers, community) can articulate the vision in their own words. They've made it their own. It's not jargon they repeat; it's something they understand because they've lived it.

**Signs of decay:**

- The vision lives in a document, not in practice. It's referenced in onboarding materials but never in actual decision-making. People have a vague sense of it but can't articulate why their current work matters to
