# Meeting Discipline

### 1. Overview

Meeting Discipline is a pattern that establishes a set of principles and practices to ensure that meetings are purposeful, productive, and respectful of participants' time and energy. The core purpose of this pattern is to transform meetings from often-dreaded time-wasters into valuable opportunities for collaboration, decision-making, and progress. It addresses the common problem of poorly managed meetings in the startup and business context, which can lead to decreased productivity, frustration, and a waste of valuable resources. By implementing Meeting Discipline, organizations can create a culture of effective collaboration, where meetings are seen as a strategic tool for achieving collective goals rather than a necessary evil.

The origins of meeting management can be traced back to the late 19th century with the development of parliamentary procedure, most famously codified in Robert's Rules of Order. However, the modern concept of meeting discipline has been shaped by numerous management thinkers and practitioners over the years, including Peter Drucker, who emphasized the importance of clear objectives and preparation. More recently, companies like Amazon and Google have become known for their specific and often rigorous approaches to meetings, such as the famous "two-pizza rule" at Amazon, which limits the size of meeting groups to what two pizzas can feed. These modern interpretations have further refined the principles of meeting discipline, adapting them to the fast-paced and dynamic nature of contemporary business.

In the context of commons-aligned value creation, Meeting Discipline plays a crucial role in fostering a culture of shared ownership and collective intelligence. By ensuring that all voices are heard and that decisions are made transparently and collaboratively, this pattern helps to build trust and a sense of shared purpose within a community. It also promotes the efficient use of shared resources, such as time and attention, which are essential for the long-term sustainability of any commons-based project. By creating a structured and respectful environment for dialogue and decision-making, Meeting Discipline enables a community to effectively steward its shared resources and create value for all its members.

### 2. Core Principles

1.  **Purposeful Agenda:** Every meeting must have a clear, stated purpose and a detailed agenda that is shared with all participants in advance. This ensures that everyone understands the goals of the meeting and can come prepared to contribute effectively.
2.  **Respect for Time:** Meetings should start and end on time, and the duration of the meeting should be appropriate for the agenda. This principle emphasizes the importance of treating time as a valuable and finite resource for all participants.
3.  **Active Participation:** All participants are expected to actively engage in the meeting, contributing their ideas and perspectives in a respectful and constructive manner. This principle fosters a culture of collaboration and shared ownership of the meeting's outcomes.
4.  **Clear Roles and Responsibilities:** The roles of the meeting leader, facilitator, and participants should be clearly defined. This includes clarifying who is responsible for making decisions, who is providing input, and who is responsible for follow-up actions.
5.  **Action-Oriented Outcomes:** Every meeting should result in clear, actionable outcomes, including decisions made, next steps, and assigned responsibilities. This ensures that the meeting leads to tangible progress and that momentum is not lost.
6.  **Continuous Improvement:** The effectiveness of meetings should be regularly assessed, and feedback should be collected from participants to identify areas for improvement. This principle promotes a culture of learning and continuous improvement in how meetings are conducted.

### 3. Key Practices

1.  **Mandatory Agendas with Outcomes:** No meeting is scheduled without a clear agenda that outlines the topics for discussion and, most importantly, the desired outcomes for each topic. This practice, often summarized as "no agenda, no attenda," empowers team members to decline meetings that lack a clear purpose, ensuring that time is spent productively.
2.  **Pre-Meeting Material Distribution:** All relevant documents, reports, or presentations are distributed to participants at least 24 hours before the meeting. This allows everyone to come prepared, having already reviewed the necessary information, which in turn allows meeting time to be focused on discussion and decision-making rather than information dissemination.
3.  **The Two-Pizza Rule:** Popularized by Amazon, this practice limits the number of attendees in a meeting to a group that could be fed by two large pizzas (typically 5-8 people). This encourages smaller, more focused discussions and ensures that everyone present has a clear role and reason for being there.
4.  **Timeboxing and Facilitation:** Each agenda item is allocated a specific time limit, and a designated facilitator is responsible for keeping the discussion on track and within the allotted time. This prevents conversations from derailing and ensures that all agenda items are addressed.
5.  **Clear Action Item Capture:** A designated notetaker is responsible for capturing all decisions made and action items assigned during the meeting. These action items should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART), and should clearly state who is responsible for each task and the deadline for completion.
6.  **Silent Starts:** Some teams, notably at Amazon, begin meetings with a period of silent reading of a detailed memo that outlines the topic for discussion. This ensures that all participants have a shared understanding of the context and data before the discussion begins, leading to more informed and productive conversations.
7.  **Device-Free or Focused Time:** To encourage active participation and minimize distractions, some organizations implement a "lids-down" policy, where laptops and phones are not used during meetings unless they are directly related to the discussion. This promotes focused attention and engagement from all participants.
8.  **Post-Meeting Summaries and Feedback:** A summary of the meeting, including key decisions and action items, is sent to all participants (and any other relevant stakeholders) within 24 hours. Additionally, a brief, regular feedback mechanism (e.g., a quick poll or a round of comments at the end of the meeting) is used to continuously improve the meeting process.

### 4. Implementation

Implementing Meeting Discipline within an organization requires a conscious and collective effort, starting with a clear commitment from leadership. A step-by-step approach can help to ensure a smooth transition. First, the organization should collaboratively define its own set of meeting principles and practices, based on the core principles of Meeting Discipline but tailored to its specific context and culture. This could be done through a series of workshops or working groups. Once these guidelines are established, they should be clearly communicated to all employees, along with the rationale behind them. Training sessions can be helpful to ensure that everyone understands the new expectations and has the necessary skills to facilitate and participate in effective meetings. It is also important to provide templates for agendas and meeting summaries to make it easier for people to adopt the new practices.

Key considerations for a successful implementation include the need for consistent reinforcement and modeling of the desired behaviors by leaders. If leaders continue to schedule meetings without agendas or allow them to run over time, the initiative will quickly lose credibility. It is also important to be patient and to recognize that it will take time for new habits to form. Regular check-ins and feedback sessions can help to identify what is working well and what needs to be adjusted. Real-world examples of successful implementation can be found in companies like Google, which uses a variety of techniques to keep meetings focused and productive, such as appointing a "decider" for every meeting and ensuring that all meetings have clear goals. Similarly, the widespread adoption of agile methodologies has introduced practices like the daily stand-up meeting, which is a highly structured and time-boxed meeting designed to promote coordination and accountability.

To ensure the long-term success of Meeting Discipline, it is important to integrate it into the organization's culture and performance management systems. This could include incorporating meeting effectiveness as a metric in team and individual performance reviews. It is also helpful to celebrate successes and to share stories of how improved meeting discipline has led to better outcomes. By making Meeting Discipline a shared responsibility and a visible priority, organizations can create a culture of collaboration and respect that values everyone's time and contribution, ultimately leading to a more effective and engaged workforce.

### 5. 7 Pillars Assessment

| Pillar | Score (1-5) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | 4 | Meeting discipline directly supports the clarification and execution of a commons' purpose by ensuring that collective time is spent on what truly matters. By requiring clear agendas and desired outcomes, it forces a continuous alignment of activities with the overarching mission. |
| Governance | 4 | This pattern provides a micro-governance structure for the commons. It establishes clear roles, ensures that decision-making processes are transparent, and creates a space for all members to have a voice. This strengthens the democratic and participatory nature of the commons. |
| Culture | 4 | A culture of meeting discipline fosters respect for every member's time and contribution. It promotes a collaborative and accountable environment where people feel valued and engaged. This is a cornerstone of a healthy commons culture. |
| Incentives | 2 | The primary incentives for adopting meeting discipline are intrinsic: less frustration, more productive use of time, and a greater sense of accomplishment. However, the pattern does not directly address economic or other extrinsic incentives for contributing to the commons. |
| Knowledge | 4 | By promoting the sharing of information before meetings and the clear documentation of decisions and action items after meetings, this pattern significantly enhances the creation and distribution of knowledge within the commons. It helps to build a shared understanding and a collective memory. |
| Technology | 3 | While not a technology itself, meeting discipline can be greatly enhanced by a variety of digital tools for scheduling, agenda creation, collaborative note-taking, and video conferencing. However, the pattern is not dependent on any specific technology and can be implemented with very basic tools. |
| Resilience | 3 | By improving the efficiency and effectiveness of communication and decision-making, meeting discipline can help a commons to respond more effectively to challenges and opportunities. However, its contribution to long-term resilience is indirect and depends on how it is combined with other patterns. |
| **Overall** | **3.4** | **Meeting Discipline has a Medium alignment with the 7 Pillars. It provides a strong foundation for effective collaboration and governance within a commons, but its impact on incentives and long-term resilience is less direct.** |


### 6. When to Use

- **When meetings are consistently running over time and failing to produce clear outcomes.** This is a primary indicator that a lack of discipline is wasting valuable time and resources.
- **When team members express frustration or disengagement with the meeting culture.** Low morale and complaints about "too many meetings" are strong signals that a change is needed.
- **During periods of rapid growth or organizational change.** As teams expand and complexity increases, informal meeting habits often break down, necessitating a more structured approach.
- **In distributed or remote teams where clear communication and coordination are paramount.** The structure provided by Meeting Discipline is essential for keeping remote teams aligned and productive.
- **When embarking on complex projects that require tight coordination and clear decision-making.** The pattern ensures that project meetings are focused, efficient, and drive progress.
- **In any organization that values a culture of respect, accountability, and a focus on results.** Meeting Discipline is a tangible way to demonstrate and reinforce these cultural values.

### 7. Anti-Patterns and Gotchas

- **Weaponizing the Rules:** Using the rules of meeting discipline to shut down important but difficult conversations, or to exclude people from the decision-making process. The goal is to improve collaboration, not to create a new form of bureaucracy.
- **Form over Substance:** Focusing on the superficial aspects of meeting discipline, such as having an agenda and starting on time, while ignoring the more important principles of active participation and clear outcomes. A well-formatted agenda is useless if the meeting itself is unproductive.
- **Meeting Overload:** Even with well-run meetings, it is possible to have too many of them. Meeting discipline should be combined with a critical assessment of whether a meeting is the best way to achieve a particular goal. Sometimes, an email, a shared document, or a quick one-on-one conversation is more effective.
- **Ignoring Power Dynamics:** Meeting discipline can help to create a more level playing field, but it does not eliminate power dynamics. It is important to be aware of how power and hierarchy can influence who speaks, whose ideas are heard, and how decisions are made.
- **Lack of Follow-Through:** The most disciplined meeting is a waste of time if the decisions made and the action items assigned are not followed up on. A system for tracking and ensuring accountability for action items is an essential complement to meeting discipline.
- **One Size Fits All:** Applying the same rigid set of rules to all types of meetings. A creative brainstorming session requires a different approach than a formal decision-making meeting. The principles of meeting discipline should be adapted to the specific context and purpose of each meeting.
