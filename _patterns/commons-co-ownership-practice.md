Differentiated stewardship holds co-ownership as a web of calibrated responsibilities and rights, not as equal shareholding.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Commons Theory / Governance.

### Section 1: Context

Most commons fail not because people lack commitment but because ownership structures flatten complexity into false equality. A product team cannot govern like a watershed. A public service cooperative cannot decide like an activist coalition. Yet all face the same centrifugal force: when everyone owns everything equally, no one tends anything carefully.

The living system here is a commons under pressure—growing in scope (more stakeholders, more value types) or fragmenting (decision paralysis, silent resentment, free-riding). In corporate contexts, this appears as venture-backed open-source projects struggling to balance company employees with volunteer contributors. In government, it's public agencies trying to shift from hierarchy to collaborative stewardship with citizens and private partners. Activist movements face it as they scale from tight collectives to distributed networks. Tech products encounter it when community governance tries to replicate without acknowledging that maintainers carry load a casual user never will.

The pattern responds to a specific recognition: co-ownership works best when people see and accept their actual role in the system's metabolism. A watershed commons needs hydrologists, farmers, and civic users—each stewarding differently. The tension emerges exactly at the boundary where abstract principle meets concrete asymmetry.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Commons vs. Practice.**

The commons ideal says: shared stewardship, equal voice, collective benefit. This vision is vital—it prevents capture and decay. But practice reveals an uncomfortable truth: stewards do not contribute equally. A maintainer of critical infrastructure holds different knowledge, bears different consequences, and carries different load than a occasional user.

When this asymmetry is denied or flattened, two pathologies emerge:

**The commons path overextends:** Governance structures designed for equality impose uniform decision-making on roles that are structurally unequal. Every voice counts equally in votes, but not every voice has spent years understanding system failure modes. Decisions slow. Expertise gets drowned in volume. The system becomes brittle—responsive to pressure but not capable of long-term cultivation.

**The practice path calcifies:** Real practitioners—those with deep skin in the game—begin to hoard responsibility. They stop sharing knowledge because collaboration feels slower than control. They make unilateral decisions because the commons process feels inefficient. The system fragments into fiefdoms. Newcomers sense they are not truly welcome. Vitality drains.

The breaking point comes when a critical decision arrives: Should we change the core protocol? Merge with a competitor? Shift resource allocation? Under flat co-ownership, the process becomes either gridlocked (everyone has veto power) or delegitimized (a few decide and others feel betrayed).

The pattern recognizes that co-ownership is real and necessary—but it must be *differentiated*: roles, rights, and responsibilities calibrated to actual contribution, capability, and structural position within the system's metabolism.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, map the actual stewardship roles within the commons, assign decision rights and resource control proportionate to each role's contribution and accountability, and make that calibration transparent and renegotiable.**

Co-ownership is not about equal power; it is about *legitimate* power. A commons only generates durable legitimacy when every participant understands *why* decisions flow through particular channels and *what recourse exists* if those channels fail.

This pattern operates by shifting from a single ownership question ("Who owns this?") to a layered stewardship ecology. In a living system, different tissues have different functions. The root system does not govern as the canopy does. Both are necessary. Both are owned—in the sense of being stewarded with care.

Differentiated co-ownership names three things explicitly:

**Role**: What is this person or group actually doing in the system's metabolism? Are they a core maintainer, a knowledge-keeper, a resource contributor, a daily user, a beneficiary? The role is structural, not honorary.

**Rights**: What decisions can this role make unilaterally? What decisions require consultation? What decisions require consensus? What access to resources comes with the role? These rights must match the decision's scope and consequence.

**Accountability**: What are the consequences if this role fails to steward well? What feedback mechanisms exist? How can a role be challenged, revoked, or evolved?

The genius of this pattern is that it *allows people to see themselves in the commons*. A volunteer contributor to open-source software can see they have genuine rights (to shape features they care about, to refuse volunteer labor on exploitative tasks) *without* needing to claim equal say in infrastructure decisions that require 15 years of system knowledge. A citizen co-producing public service understands they can influence policy direction *while* recognizing that full-time civil servants carry accountability for operational continuity they do not.

This shift generates trust. Not because everyone gets what they want, but because the reasoning is transparent and roots in ecological reality, not ideology.

### Section 4: Implementation

**Corporate (Venture-Backed Open Source):**
Establish a tiered contribution charter. Map roles: core maintainers (code ownership, architecture decisions), feature contributors (propose and implement features, veto power on PRs touching their domain), users (can raise issues, cannot merge code). Assign each tier explicit decision rights. A maintainer can merge code; a feature contributor can block a merge only on their owned subsystem; a user can appeal blocking decisions to the maintainer council. Publish the charter as a living document. Renew assignments annually or when roles shift. When Kubernetes governance evolved toward this model, decision velocity increased because contributors stopped second-guessing whether they had standing to act.

**Government (Public Service):**
Design stewardship circles concentric around decision type. Core services (water treatment, emergency response) stay under civil servant stewardship but with citizen advisory councils holding real veto power on spending priorities. Co-design circles bring practitioners and residents into joint decision-making on service delivery but with staff retaining duty-of-care authority on safety and continuity. Open input channels allow anyone to raise issues, but processing and response routes run through the appropriate stewardship level. Denmark's neighborhood improvement councils work this way: citizens direct project priorities, professional teams execute, and escalation paths exist when conflicts arise. This preserves both responsiveness and capacity.

**Activist (Distributed Movement):**
Create role-based affinity groups with explicit bandwidth commitments. Full-time organizers hold coordination authority over campaign timeline and coalition messaging but answer to the strategy circle. Part-time volunteers commit to specific tasks (communications, fundraising, training) and make decisions within their domain autonomously. Occasional participants can contribute labor on events and campaigns without governance weight. The Standing Rock movement operated informally this way: core organizers made tactical decisions in real time, affinity groups executed strategy they had shaped in planning phases, and thousands participated without pretense of equal governance. Formalizing this prevented burnout and clarified when consensus was actually needed versus when coordination sufficed.

**Tech (Community-Governed Products):**
Codify governance in smart contracts or formal protocols. Users holding governance tokens have voting weight proportional to their long-term stake (historical usage, capital contributed, or reputation earned). Developers holding commit rights make unilateral changes to non-breaking systems but require token-holder review for core protocol shifts. Treasury decisions split: maintainers control spending up to monthly threshold; above that, token holders vote. Uniswap's governance model uses this structure: liquidity providers (those with skin in the game) have voting power; developers (those with technical accountability) have veto rights on unsafe upgrades; any token holder can propose changes. This prevents governance capture while ensuring technical stewardship is not overruled by noise.

**Across all contexts:**
1. **Create a visible stewardship map.** Draw it. Name each role, the decisions it controls, the access it gets, the accountability it carries. Update it quarterly. Post it where decisions happen.
2. **Hold role-negotiation ceremonies twice yearly.** Bring stewards together to surface role mismatches. Someone volunteering like a maintainer but titled as a contributor? Rename the role or expand the resource. This prevents resentment from calcifying.
3. **Build escalation paths with real teeth.** If a role-holder abuses their authority, what happens? Create a light appeal process (most issues resolve in conversation) and a heavier arbitration process (rare, used when role-holder refuses to listen).
4. **Track decision outcomes by role.** Which decisions made by maintainers succeeded? Which decisions made by consensus-seeking circles thrived? Use data to refine role boundaries, not to consolidate power.

---

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

This pattern generates three things: *clarity* (people know where they stand and what they can influence), *trust* (decisions feel legitimate because the reasoning is visible), and *distributed capacity* (people who are close to problems can act on them without waiting for universal consensus).

When stewardship roles are explicit and transparent, newcomers integrate faster. They do not have to intuit the unspoken hierarchy; they can see it, choose whether to accept it, and find their legitimate place. This accelerates both learning and contribution.

The pattern also creates space for *experimentation within bounds*. A maintainer can try a new approach to code review in their domain; a community organizer can pilot a new meeting format with their affinity group. Experimentation does not destabilize the whole system because stewardship roles contain the blast radius.

Most importantly, this pattern lets the commons *mature without ossifying*. As a system grows, decision-making does not collapse into either tyranny-of-consensus or hidden oligarchy. Roles evolve because their boundaries are visible and renegotiable.

**What risks emerge:**

The pattern's greatest vulnerability is *rigidity*. Once roles are named and documented, they can harden into caste. A person labeled "contributor" for three years internalizes that as their ceiling. A "maintainer" role can become a fiefdom protected by claimed necessity. The vibrant ecosystem turns bureaucratic.

This risk sits directly in the vitality assessment: the pattern sustains existing health (3.5 vitality) but does not necessarily build new adaptive capacity (3.0 resilience). If role descriptions are not renegotiated frequently and with genuine openness to change, the commons calcifies.

A second risk is *legitimacy collapse*. If the stewardship map was built without involving affected people, it will be experienced as imposed, not negotiated. Suddenly naming "who decides" creates resentment if it reveals power structures people thought were hidden or absent.

Relatedly, the pattern can become *theatre*: roles are named but real decisions continue to flow through invisible channels. Users see a governance structure but discover it has no teeth. This is worse than no structure because it breeds cynicism.

The asymmetry in accountability is real and can breed resentment. A maintainer has high responsibility for system health; a casual user has none. If the commons does not celebrate and resource maintenance work visibly and generously, the maintainer burns out and abandons the commons. The sustainability of differentiated stewardship depends on distributing not just decision rights but *gratitude, resources, and rest*.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Wikipedia's Editorial Hierarchies (Knowledge Commons):**
Wikipedia emerged as a radically open commons but evolved explicit stewardship roles because chaos threatened quality. Today: any user can edit, but vandalism requires good-faith assumption that is testable. Editors (high-volume contributors with reputation) can revert edits; admins can protect pages; arbitration committees settle disputes. This tiered stewardship let the commons scale from 100,000 articles to 6 million while maintaining integrity. New editors see they can contribute meaningfully without needing admin status. Admins know their power comes with duty to serve, not to rule. The stewardship roles are transparent (anyone can see edit history and trace authority), renegotiable (editors can lose status; admins face removal), and tied to actual contribution.

**Mondragon Corporation (Worker Cooperatives):**
Mondragon is a federation of 80,000+ worker-owners across manufacturing, retail, and finance. Rather than "one person, one vote" across all decisions, Mondragon created nested stewardship: workers own their cooperative and elect its board; the cooperative owns shares in the federation; the federation has governance bodies for cross-cooperative decisions (strategy, shared services, conflict resolution). A factory worker can vote on local cooperative decisions (budget, working conditions) but trusts federation-level roles for decisions about supply chain strategy that require visibility across 200+ entities. This differentiation let Mondragon remain worker-owned and democratic while achieving scale and resilience that non-hierarchical collectives typically cannot. Roles are explicit: workers understand the difference between local governance (high participation) and federation governance (delegate-based). Accountability runs through regular assemblies where leadership must report outcomes.

**Ethereum's Governance Fragmentation (Tech Protocol Commons):**
Ethereum's attempted transition to decentralized governance reveals both the power and peril of this pattern. Early on, decisions flowed through Vitalik Buterin and core developer teams (implicit stewardship, concentrated authority). As the ecosystem grew, governance formalized: EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) require developer consensus; major upgrades now involve community signaling. But Ethereum discovered that naming stewardship roles *without* clear enforcement mechanisms creates friction. Developer teams claim technical authority to refuse unsafe proposals, but lack formal veto. Token holders claim governance authority but lack technical knowledge to evaluate proposals meaningfully. The result: governance often feels frozen or invisible. Ethereum's current experience teaches that differentiated co-ownership requires not just naming roles but *embedding them in technical and social architecture* so that authority and accountability are actually enforceable, not merely suggested.

---

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age of AI and distributed intelligence, differentiated stewardship takes on new dimensions and new dangers.

**New leverage:** AI can automate the visibility work this pattern requires. Smart contract governance can enforce role-based decision rights algorithmically; machine learning can detect when a role-holder is behaving outside their mandate. This makes the pattern *cheaper to maintain* at scale—governance no longer requires constant human negotiation of boundaries.

AI also creates new *expertise asymmetries*. A person who understands how to prompt a large language model or configure a multi-agent system has knowledge most participants lack. This expertise is real and consequential. Differentiated stewardship becomes more important, not less: the commons needs to be explicit about which decisions require technical AI fluency and which do not. Otherwise, AI capability becomes another vector for hidden power concentration.

**New risks:** AI-driven tools can make role-based governance *feel* transparent while actually obscuring decision-making. A recommendation algorithm suggests which proposals get voted on; a classifier determines which comments are "relevant" to a decision. These tools embed values (whose values matter? what counts as relevance?) but appear neutral. In this context, the pattern's requirement for *visible reasoning* becomes critical. Governance systems using AI must expose how roles were assigned, which decisions AI is influencing, and who audits that influence.

Tech context translation amplifies this: decentralized protocols can use AI to optimize allocation of governance rights (e.g., assigning voting weight based on demonstrated knowledge and stake). But this creates a new problem: *who governs the AI*? If a machine learning model determines who counts as a legitimate steward, the commons needs explicit oversight of that model. The pattern must nest: differentiated stewardship of the commons *includes* differentiated stewardship of the governance tools themselves.

**Speculative edge:** In multi-stakeholder networks (corporate platforms, civic infrastructure, open-science collectives), AI could enable *dynamic role assignment*. Rather than static roles, a person's stewardship authority might shift based on current context and demonstrated competence. This is powerful—a person could hold high authority in decisions where they have skin in the game and low authority in decisions where they do not. But it also risks constant micro-negotiations that drain trust. The pattern will need to balance fluidity with stability.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

- **Role clarity produces fast decisions.** Observe whether decisions on core questions (protocol changes, resource allocation, major conflicts) are made within expected timeframes with clear ownership of implementation. When people know who decides, decision velocity increases even if not everyone agrees.

- **Newcomers find their level quickly.** Track how long it takes for a new contributor or stakeholder to make their first meaningful contribution without asking permission. If people are quickly identifying which decisions they can influence, the stewardship map is working. If new people keep asking "can I do this?" and getting vague answers, the map is either hidden or dishonest.

- **Stewards visibly age and transition.** A healthy commons renews its stewardship. You should see old maintainers stepping back, training successors, and moving into mentor roles. You should see new people taking on core responsibility. If the same people hold all power after five years, the roles have hardened into tenure, not responsibility.

- **Conflicts resolve at the right level.** Small disagreements between contributors get resolved in their domain. Bigger conflicts escalate to the appropriate stewardship council. The fact that escalation happens (not that it is rare) is the health signal. It means people trust the process enough to use it.

**Signs of decay:**

- **Roles exist on paper but decisions happen elsewhere.** The governance charter names stewards, but real decisions flow through informal channels—a Slack conversation, a dinner between insiders, whispered lobbying. People feel the decision was already made before the formal process started. Legitimacy drains.

- **Stewards become gatekeepers instead of cultivators.** A maintainer stops mentoring and starts blocking. An organizer stops inviting people in and starts defending territory. The stewardship role flips from "I help this system thrive" to "I protect my position." Contribution slows. Diversity declines.

- **Role assignments become static and inheritance-based.** If stewardship
