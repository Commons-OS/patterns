# Net-Positive Design

## 1. Overview

Net-Positive Design is a paradigm shift in the way we think about and create our built environment. It moves beyond the conventional goal of simply minimizing negative impacts—a concept often referred to as 'net-zero' or 'sustainable' design—to a more ambitious and restorative approach. The fundamental premise of Net-Positive Design is to create buildings, products, and systems that contribute more to the environment and society than they consume over their entire lifecycle. This means actively regenerating ecosystems, generating surplus energy, and fostering social equity, rather than merely reducing harm. [1] [4]

In a world grappling with the escalating crises of climate change, resource depletion, and social inequality, the philosophy of 'doing less bad' is no longer sufficient. Net-Positive Design challenges the status quo by asserting that our creations can and should be a force for good. It reframes the design process as an opportunity to heal the planet and improve human well-being, transforming our built environment from a source of degradation into a catalyst for regeneration. This approach requires a holistic and systems-thinking perspective, considering the interconnectedness of ecological, social, and economic factors at every stage of the design, construction, and operation process.

## 2. Core Principles

Net-Positive Design is guided by a set of core principles that differentiate it from traditional and sustainable design approaches. These principles provide a framework for creating projects that are truly regenerative and contribute positively to the world.

### 1. Ecological Regeneration

At the heart of Net-Positive Design is the principle of ecological regeneration. This goes beyond simply minimizing environmental harm and actively seeks to restore and enhance the natural environment. The goal is to leave ecosystems in a better state than they were before the project began. This can be achieved by: [5]

*   **Increasing Biodiversity:** Creating habitats that support a wide range of native flora and fauna.
*   **Restoring Ecological Functions:** Re-establishing natural processes such as water filtration, soil formation, and carbon sequestration.
*   **Expanding Ecological Space:** Increasing the area of land and water dedicated to nature.

### 2. Social Equity and Well-being

Net-Positive Design recognizes that a truly sustainable future must be just and equitable for all. This principle focuses on improving the quality of life for all members of society, particularly the most vulnerable. Key aspects of this principle include:

*   **Promoting Environmental Justice:** Ensuring that the benefits of a project are shared equitably and that no community is disproportionately burdened by its negative impacts.
*   **Enhancing Public Health and Well-being:** Creating healthy and supportive environments that promote physical and mental well-being.
*   **Fostering Community and Connection:** Designing spaces that encourage social interaction and a sense of community.

## 3. Key Practices

Net-Positive Design is put into action through a variety of key practices that translate its core principles into tangible outcomes. These practices are not a rigid checklist but rather a flexible toolkit that can be adapted to the specific context of each project.

### 1. Whole-Systems Thinking

This practice involves looking beyond the immediate boundaries of a project and considering its broader impacts on the environment, society, and the economy. It requires a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of various systems and a commitment to finding solutions that are beneficial for the whole system, not just one part of it.

### 2. Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA)

LCA is a systematic analysis of the environmental impacts of a product, service, or building throughout its entire life cycle, from raw material extraction to disposal or recycling. This practice helps designers identify and prioritize areas for improvement, such as reducing embodied carbon, minimizing waste, and selecting materials with lower environmental footprints. [2]

### 3. Regenerative Material Selection

This practice involves choosing materials that are not only sustainable but also contribute to the regeneration of natural systems. This can include using materials with high recycled content, sourcing materials from responsibly managed forests, and selecting materials that are biodegradable or can be safely returned to the earth at the end of their life.

### 4. On-Site Renewable Energy Generation

A key practice of Net-Positive Design is to generate more energy than a project consumes. This is typically achieved through the use of on-site renewable energy systems, such as photovoltaic (PV) panels, wind turbines, or geothermal systems. The surplus energy can then be fed back into the grid, contributing to a cleaner and more resilient energy system. [2]

### 5. Water Stewardship

Net-Positive Design promotes responsible water management through practices such as rainwater harvesting, greywater recycling, and the use of water-efficient fixtures and landscaping. The goal is to reduce reliance on municipal water supplies and to ensure that the water that is returned to the environment is clean and healthy.

## 4. Application Context

Net-Positive Design is a versatile framework that can be applied across a wide range of project types and scales, from individual products and buildings to entire neighborhoods and cities. However, its application is particularly well-suited to contexts where there is a strong commitment to sustainability and a desire to create long-term value for both people and the planet.

### New Construction

New construction projects offer a prime opportunity to implement Net-Positive Design from the ground up. By integrating its principles and practices into the earliest stages of the design process, it is possible to create buildings that are not only highly efficient and sustainable but also regenerative and restorative. The Wells Fargo campus in Irving, Texas, serves as an excellent example of how Net-Positive Design can be successfully applied to a large-scale corporate campus, resulting in a facility that generates more energy than it consumes and provides a healthy and productive work environment for its employees. [2]

### Retrofitting Existing Buildings

While new construction presents a blank slate for Net-Positive Design, the vast majority of our built environment already exists. Retrofitting existing buildings to be more sustainable and regenerative is therefore a critical challenge and a significant opportunity. Net-Positive Design principles can be applied to retrofitting projects to improve energy efficiency, reduce water consumption, and enhance the health and well-being of building occupants. This can involve a wide range of interventions, from simple upgrades such as installing energy-efficient lighting and water fixtures to more comprehensive renovations that involve deep energy retrofits and the integration of on-site renewable energy systems.

### Urban Planning and Development

Net-Positive Design can also be applied at the scale of urban planning and development to create more sustainable and resilient cities. By taking a whole-systems approach, planners and developers can design neighborhoods and districts that are not only environmentally friendly but also socially equitable and economically vibrant. This can involve creating mixed-use developments that reduce the need for driving, preserving and restoring natural ecosystems within the urban fabric, and creating public spaces that foster community and connection.

## 5. Implementation

Implementing Net-Positive Design requires a collaborative and iterative process that involves all stakeholders, from the client and design team to the contractors and building occupants. The following steps provide a general framework for implementing Net-Positive Design in a project.

### 1. Establish a Clear Vision and Goals

The first step is to establish a clear vision and a set of ambitious but achievable goals for the project. This should be done in close collaboration with the client and other key stakeholders to ensure that everyone is aligned on the project's objectives. The goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) and should address all three pillars of sustainability: environmental, social, and economic.

### 2. Conduct a Comprehensive Site Analysis

A thorough understanding of the project site is essential for designing a net-positive project. This includes analyzing the site's climate, topography, hydrology, and ecology, as well as its social and cultural context. A solar radiation analysis, for example, can inform the building's orientation and the design of its shading systems, while an analysis of the local ecosystem can help identify opportunities for habitat restoration and biodiversity enhancement. [2]

### 3. Assemble an Integrated Design Team

Net-Positive Design requires a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach. It is therefore essential to assemble an integrated design team that includes architects, engineers, landscape architects, sustainability consultants, and other specialists. This team should work together from the earliest stages of the project to ensure that all aspects of the design are aligned with the project's net-positive goals.

### 4. Use an Iterative Design Process

The design process for a net-positive project should be iterative and evidence-based. This means using tools such as energy modeling and life-cycle assessment to evaluate the performance of different design options and to make informed decisions. The design team should be prepared to test and refine their ideas throughout the design process to arrive at the optimal solution.

### 5. Prioritize Passive Design Strategies

Before resorting to active systems, it is important to maximize the use of passive design strategies to reduce the building's energy and resource consumption. This includes optimizing the building's orientation and form, using natural ventilation and daylighting, and incorporating high-performance building envelope systems.

### 6. Select Regenerative Materials and Systems

The selection of materials and systems is a critical aspect of Net-Positive Design. The design team should prioritize materials that are locally sourced, have a high recycled content, and are low in embodied carbon. They should also select systems that are highly efficient and that contribute to the regeneration of natural systems, such as rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling systems.

### 7. Monitor and Verify Performance

Once the project is complete, it is essential to monitor and verify its performance to ensure that it is meeting its net-positive goals. This can involve collecting data on energy and water consumption, as well as conducting post-occupancy evaluations to assess the health and well-being of the building's occupants. The data collected can then be used to fine-tune the building's operations and to inform the design of future projects.

## 6. Evidence & Impact

The most compelling evidence for the impact of Net-Positive Design comes from real-world projects that have successfully implemented its principles and practices. These projects demonstrate that it is possible to create buildings and communities that are not only environmentally friendly but also economically viable and socially equitable.

### The Wells Fargo Campus: A Case Study in Net-Positive Design

The Wells Fargo campus in Irving, Texas, is a landmark project that showcases the potential of Net-Positive Design to transform the corporate built environment. The project, which was designed by Corgan, is on track to become the first net-positive corporate campus in the United States. [2]

The campus, which consists of two office towers and a parking garage, was designed to generate more energy than it consumes. This was achieved through a combination of passive design strategies, energy-efficient systems, and a massive on-site solar array. The project is expected to achieve a net-positive energy (NPE) of 4.9%, meaning that it will generate 4.9% more energy than it consumes. [2]

In addition to its impressive energy performance, the Wells Fargo campus also incorporates a number of other sustainable design features, including:

*   **Water conservation:** The project is expected to use 58% less water than a baseline project, thanks to the use of non-potable water for irrigation and the selection of low-water-use plants. [2]
*   **Reduced embodied carbon:** The project team reduced the embodied carbon of the building by 14% by using Portland limestone cement (Type IL) instead of traditional cement. [2]
*   **Enhanced indoor environmental quality:** The project features a high-performance building envelope and a dynamic glazing system that optimizes natural light and minimizes solar heat gain, creating a comfortable and healthy work environment for employees. [2]

### Broader Impacts and Benefits

The benefits of Net-Positive Design extend far beyond individual buildings. By creating a surplus of resources, such as energy and water, net-positive projects can contribute to the resilience and sustainability of the broader community. They can also help to reduce the strain on municipal infrastructure and create a healthier and more livable environment for everyone.

Furthermore, Net-Positive Design can have a positive impact on the economy. By investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy, net-positive projects can reduce operating costs and create green jobs. They can also help to stimulate innovation in the building industry and create a more sustainable and resilient economy.


## 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

The Cognitive Era, characterized by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and other advanced technologies, presents both opportunities and challenges for Net-Positive Design. If leveraged thoughtfully and ethically, these technologies can significantly enhance our ability to create regenerative and restorative systems. However, they also have the potential to exacerbate existing problems if not implemented with care.

### Opportunities

*   **AI-Powered Design Optimization:** AI algorithms can be used to analyze vast amounts of data and to identify optimal design solutions that would be impossible for humans to find on their own. For example, AI can be used to optimize building form and orientation for passive solar design, to design more efficient renewable energy systems, and to select materials with the lowest possible environmental impact. [3]
*   **Generative Design:** Generative design tools can be used to explore a wide range of design possibilities and to create innovative solutions that are both beautiful and sustainable. By setting goals and constraints, designers can use generative design to create buildings and products that are optimized for performance, aesthetics, and sustainability.
*   **Smart Building Operation:** AI-powered building management systems can be used to optimize the performance of buildings in real-time. By learning the occupancy patterns of a building and by responding to changes in the weather, these systems can reduce energy consumption, improve occupant comfort, and extend the life of building systems.

### Challenges

*   **The Rebound Effect:** As AI and other technologies make it easier and cheaper to design and build, there is a risk that we will simply build more, negating any efficiency gains. This is known as the rebound effect, and it is a major challenge for sustainable design.
*   **The Digital Divide:** The benefits of AI and other advanced technologies are not always shared equally. There is a risk that these technologies will exacerbate the existing digital divide, leaving behind those who do not have access to them.
*   **The Black Box Problem:** Many AI algorithms are so complex that it is difficult to understand how they arrive at their decisions. This is known as the black box problem, and it can make it difficult to trust the recommendations of AI-powered design tools.

## 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

Net-Positive Design has a moderate alignment with the principles of the commons. While it shares the commons' goal of creating a more sustainable and equitable world, its primary focus is on the built environment, and it does not always explicitly address the broader social and political dimensions of the commons.

### 1. Openness and Transparency

Net-Positive Design has a moderate alignment with this principle. While the principles and practices of Net-Positive Design are widely shared, the specific details of individual projects are not always made public. There is a need for greater transparency in the field to ensure that best practices are shared and that lessons are learned from both successes and failures.

### 2. Participation and Collaboration

Net-Positive Design has a high alignment with this principle. The implementation of Net-Positive Design requires a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach that involves all stakeholders, from the client and design team to the contractors and building occupants.

### 3. Decentralization and Distribution

Net-Positive Design has a moderate alignment with this principle. While it promotes the use of decentralized renewable energy systems, it does not always address the broader issue of decentralizing power and decision-making.

### 4. Sustainability and Resilience

Net-Positive Design has a very high alignment with this principle. The core goal of Net-Positive Design is to create buildings and communities that are both sustainable and resilient.

### 5. Equity and Justice

Net-Positive Design has a high alignment with this principle. The principle of social equity and well-being is a key component of Net-Positive Design, and it seeks to ensure that the benefits of a project are shared equitably and that no community is disproportionately burdened by its negative impacts.

### 6. Interoperability and Modularity

Net-Positive Design has a moderate alignment with this principle. While it promotes the use of modular and prefabricated components, it does not always address the broader issue of interoperability between different systems and technologies.

### 7. Stewardship and Governance

Net-Positive Design has a moderate alignment with this principle. While it promotes the responsible stewardship of natural resources, it does not always address the broader issue of governance and decision-making.
