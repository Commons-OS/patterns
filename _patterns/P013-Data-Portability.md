_# Pattern: Data Portability

## 1. Pattern Name and Number

**P013: Data Portability**

## 2. Problem

Users' personal data is often locked into the platform or service where it was created. This creates high switching costs for users, stifles competition, and prevents users from using their own data in innovative ways with other services. Users lack control and agency over the data they have generated.

## 3. Context

You are a service provider that collects and stores personal data provided by or generated by your users. You want to empower your users, build trust, and comply with regulations like GDPR that grant users a right to data portability.

## 4. Solution

**Implement a Data Portability feature that allows users to easily download a complete copy of their personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format (e.g., JSON, CSV).**

This involves:
1.  **Data Access**: Providing a clear and accessible user interface where users can initiate a data export request.
2.  **Data Compilation**: Gathering all personal data associated with the user, including their profile information, activity logs, content they have created, and data observed about them.
3.  **Data Formatting**: Structuring the data in a machine-readable format that is easy for other services to parse and import.
4.  **Secure Delivery**: Providing the data to the user in a secure manner, for example, as a password-protected zip file delivered via a secure download link.

## 5. Rationale

Data portability is a key principle of modern data protection and user empowerment. It:
- **Empowers Users**: Gives users control over their own data, allowing them to move it, use it with other services, or simply keep a copy for their own records.
- **Promotes Competition**: Lowers switching costs and allows users to more easily migrate to competing services, fostering a more competitive market.
- **Builds Trust**: Demonstrates a commitment to transparency and user control, which can be a competitive differentiator.
- **Ensures Compliance**: It is a legal requirement under GDPR (Article 20) and other data protection laws.

## 6. Consequences

- **Positive**:
    - Increased user trust and loyalty.
    - Compliance with major data protection regulations.
    - A more competitive and innovative digital market.
- **Negative**:
    - Can be technically challenging to implement, especially for complex systems with data spread across many different microservices and databases.
    - Can be abused by malicious actors (e.g., an attacker who gains control of a user's account could export all their data).
    - May make it easier for users to leave your service for a competitor.

## 7. Known Uses

- **Google Takeout**: A service that allows users of Google products to export all of their data.
- **Facebook Download Your Information**: A feature that allows Facebook users to download a copy of their data.
- **Apple's Data and Privacy Portal**: Allows Apple users to download a copy of their data.
