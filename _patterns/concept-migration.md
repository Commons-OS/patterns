### Section 1: Context

Organizations across sectors are fragmenting into specialized silos — corporate talent teams, government service designers, activist networks, and product teams all face the same underlying challenge: how to develop human capability and career pathway stewardship without reinventing the wheel. Each domain has developed powerful conceptual tools (mentorship architectures in corporate, vocation mapping in activist communities, career ladders in public service), yet these remain trapped within disciplinary walls. The commons here is one of *intellectual stewardship*: concepts that have been tested and refined through years of practice exist as dormant seeds in adjacent domains where they could take root and flourish. The fragmentation is not inevitable — it reflects a system that has not yet learned to migrate its own knowledge across permeable boundaries. A public service pathway designer watching corporate mentorship practice, or a tech product manager recognizing patterns from activist organizing — these moments signal readiness for translation.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Concept vs. Migration.**

A well-developed concept carries embedded assumptions, vocabulary, and success criteria forged in its origin context. "Career architecture" makes sense in a hierarchical corporate structure; "vocation mapping" speaks to activist authenticity. Migration asks: can this concept survive transplantation? Will it wither, or will it transform both itself and the new soil?

The tension manifests as two opposing risks. On one side, **conceptual fidelity**: practitioners cling to the original form, installing it wholesale and watching it fail because the new domain's constraints are invisible to them. A corporate mentorship program imported directly into government encounters different power dynamics, tenure expectations, and stakeholder accountability structures — and the program collapses under its own assumptions. On the other side, **abandonment through reinvention**: practitioners dismiss the concept as "not applicable here" and start over, losing decades of refinement and creating yet another isolated silo. The activist vocation mapping practice — with its emphasis on purpose alignment and collective accountability — could illuminate tech product careers, but only if someone is willing to ask: what could we learn here? Left unresolved, this tension produces either brittle transplants that wither or endless reinvention that fragments the commons further.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, establish a disciplined translation practice that tests the concept's core mechanics against the new domain's material constraints, documents what must adapt, and cultivates it iteratively with early adopters before claiming success.**

Concept migration is not transfer; it is *translation with integrity*. The pattern works by separating the concept's deep structure (the problem it solves, the relationships it catalyzes) from its surface features (vocabulary, timelines, formal roles). This separation allows the roots to take hold in new soil.

Think of a seed. The seed carries genetic information (deep structure), but the way it germinates depends entirely on soil chemistry, moisture, temperature — the new domain's constraints. A concept migrated well maintains its essential logic while allowing its form to be radically reshaped. Corporate career architecture's deep insight — that human development thrives when people can see the patterns in their own growth — remains true in government, activist, and tech contexts. But how that insight manifests will differ sharply. In government, it becomes public service pathways designed around mission and tenure. In activist work, it becomes vocation mapping rooted in values alignment. In tech, it becomes product manager ladders emphasizing learnings from failure.

The source traditions — Philosophy of Science and Design Thinking — teach us that concepts migrate successfully when we treat them as *hypotheses*, not truths. We test them. We watch for where they break. We document the breaking points. We ask: what does this domain teach us that the origin domain could not see? This reversal is crucial. Migration is not one-way; it is an exchange that enriches both source and destination. The concept arrives humbled, ready to be remade, and the new domain contributes unexpected wisdom back to the original.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**Map the concept's architecture before migration begins.** Name the core problem the concept solves, the relationships it depends on, and the success criteria that matter. In corporate career architecture, the core problem is visibility — people need to see multiple pathways forward. The relationships are vertical (mentorship), horizontal (peer learning), and institutional (succession planning). The success criteria include time-to-promotion, satisfaction, and retention in key roles. Write this down. Do not assume you understand it until you have written it.

**Identify the new domain's material constraints.** Spend time in the destination. Talk to frontline practitioners. In government service pathway design, you will discover that civil service tenure, political cycles, and public accountability create constraints corporate mentorship never faces. In activist vocation mapping, you will find that resource scarcity, volunteer turnover, and mission-driven intensity reshape what "career" even means. In tech product manager career design, you will hit the reality that learning velocity and role ambiguity create different stakes than hierarchical corporate progression. Document these constraints as *affordances* — not problems, but specific features of the domain that could shape the concept's form.

**Pilot with early adopters who understand both contexts.** Find the people in the new domain who already read across disciplinary lines, who are restless with existing solutions. In government, this might be a forward-thinking human resources director who has worked in both sectors. In activist networks, find organizers who have done corporate work and hunger for a better model. In tech, recruit product managers who care about career development. These translators become your immune system — they will flag where the concept breaks, and their early feedback shapes the adaptation.

**Run a bounded trial.** Implement the migrated concept with one team, one cohort, one initiative. Give it at least 18 months to establish roots. In a corporate setting, pilot career architecture redesign with one department. In government, test pathway design with one agency. In activist vocation mapping, run it with one campaign cycle. This is not a pilot in the startup sense (quick and disposable); it is cultivation in the agricultural sense (you are learning the soil).

**Document the adaptation at every stage.** What did you change? Why? What surprised you? What assumptions from the origin concept proved false? What new insights emerged that the origin context never had? Create a *migration journal* — not a polished report, but a working record. This journal becomes the intellectual commons; it teaches the next practitioner who attempts a similar translation.

**Establish feedback loops with the origin domain.** Tell the corporate mentorship practitioners what you learned about mentorship by trying to transplant it into activist work. Tell the activist vocation mappers what public service taught you about values alignment. This closes the circle. The concept grows stronger on both sides when the translation flows both directions.

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

New conceptual capacity emerges in the receiving domain. Government service designers who migrate career architecture thinking suddenly have a language and framework for developing talent pathways that serve the public service mission, not just organizational structure. Activist networks gain rigor in vocation mapping — a tool to retain people in long-term work by clarifying the relationship between individual purpose and collective impact. Tech product teams discover that career design is not just retention mechanics, but a practice that deepens institutional learning and speeds decision-making. The commons of human development knowledge stops fragmenting and begins to interconnect.

A second flourishing is **reciprocal insight**. The origin domain discovers blind spots. Corporate mentorship programs, tested in government, reveal their embedded assumptions about hierarchy and stability. Activist vocation mapping, translated into tech, surfaces the depth of values-work that product organizations rarely address. The concept becomes more robust, more honest, more useful everywhere.

**What risks emerge:**

Ritual substitution: the concept is adopted but emptied of its mechanics. A government agency installs "career architecture" terminology without the mentorship relationships, reflection practices, or succession transparency that make the concept work. It becomes a hollow frame, generating cynicism.

Over-adaptation creates a second risk. In the rush to fit the new domain, practitioners shed so much of the concept's original logic that it becomes unrecognizable — and loses the power it was brought in to contribute. An activist organization so thoroughly adapts career pathways to resource constraints and volunteer turnover that the concept becomes barely distinguishable from informal job shadowing.

The assessment scores flag a third risk: stakeholder_architecture and ownership are at 3.0 — borderline. Concept migration can deepen power imbalances if the translation process is not genuinely co-owned. If corporate HR practitioners transplant their concepts into government without meaningful co-design with public service leaders, the transplant carries hidden corporate assumptions about what counts as success, who gets to lead, and whose voice matters. Watch for this. Make the translation multi-voiced from the start.

Resilience scores well at 4.5, which is good news: the pattern itself is robust when done with integrity. The risk is not structural but cultural — the risk that hurried implementation or elite translation (done *to* a domain rather than *with* it) undermines the commons value this pattern could create.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Philosophy of Science: Thomas Kuhn and the translation of paradigm concepts across disciplines.** Kuhn's framework for understanding scientific revolutions — the idea that fields work within shared paradigms until anomalies accumulate and force a shift — originated in physics and history of science. Sociologists and organizational theorists migrated it into studies of institutional change. The concept proved robust enough to move, but each domain had to adapt it. Sociologists discovered that institutional paradigm shifts happen more slowly and messily than in physics; organizational leaders learned that naming the paradigm shift is itself part of the work. The concept strengthened because the translation was rigorous and bidirectional.

**Design Thinking in government: The UK Design Council's migration of design-led problem framing from commercial product design into policy and service design.** In the mid-2000s, practitioners observed that government struggled with wicked problems partly because it lacked frameworks for collaborative problem definition. They transplanted "design thinking" — the core insight that deep understanding of user needs precedes solution design — from corporate innovation into policy contexts. The concept took root, but it required fundamental adaptation. Government service design had to reckon with political stakeholder structures, public accountability, and the reality that users of public services are also voters and citizens. The translation was rigorous: the Design Council documented what had to change (timelines, stakeholder engagement, success metrics) while protecting what mattered (the discipline of user research, iterative refinement). Today, policy design is a distinct practice in government precisely because someone was careful about the migration.

**Activist organizing: The translation of "theory of change" from grassroots organizing into tech and corporate social impact work.** Community organizers developed theory of change as a tool to map the causal chain from current conditions to desired future, identifying where an organization's work could intervene most leverage. Tech companies and corporate foundations migrated the concept into impact strategy. The transplant revealed tensions. Corporate theory of change often reflects top-down certainty about what change should look like; activist versions embrace ambiguity and accountability to affected communities. Thoughtful organizations doing this migration now do it co-authored — corporate strategists sitting with community organizers, each learning from the other's version of "how change actually happens." The concept has become more honest because the migration forced both sides to name their assumptions.

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an era of AI and distributed intelligence, concept migration becomes both more urgent and more risky.

**What becomes more urgent:** AI systems can now rapidly map conceptual structures across domains, identify structural homologies, and surface translation opportunities humans would miss. A machine learning system can analyze career architecture patterns in corporate settings and flag which elements might translate to government or activist contexts. This accelerates discovery. Practitioners no longer need to wait for serendipitous cross-domain friendships; they can systematically ask: where else might this concept live?

**What becomes riskier:** AI can also seduce practitioners into false equivalence. A system that maps career architecture onto product management may find surface-level structural similarity without understanding the phenomenological difference — what it actually *feels like* to develop as a product manager in a startup versus as a civil servant. The risk is that AI-assisted translation becomes decontextualized, losing the grounded understanding of constraints, values, and stakeholder dynamics that makes a migration work. The pattern depends on *situated intelligence* — practitioners who understand both domains and feel the friction points.

**For Product Manager Career Design specifically:** The tech context is uniquely positioned to accelerate and deepen concept migration. Product managers are already translators by profession — they move concepts from user research into feature design, from market insight into product strategy. They understand iterative testing, constraint discovery, and the difference between surface features and core mechanics. The pattern amplifies here: a thoughtful PM could migrate mentorship architecture, vocation mapping, or design thinking into technical career pathways with unusual sophistication. The risk: tech moves fast and optimizes for individual mobility over institutional learning. A product manager career design system could inadvertently preserve tech's worst assumption — that growth means moving on — rather than asking what careers might become if they were rooted in long-term technical mastery and collective knowledge-building.

AI also creates new leverage for *bidirectional* translation. Activist vocation mapping, now studied by machine learning systems, could reveal insights about values-alignment and purpose-work that tech organizations urgently need. The pattern becomes powerful when AI is used not to transplant concepts faster, but to create richer feedback loops between domains — so the concept genuinely strengthens on all sides.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

The migrated concept is generating genuine surprise and pushback in the receiving domain. Practitioners in government are not simply nodding along; they are arguing with the concept, asking hard questions: "Does this assume too much stability? Does it ignore political cycles? Could we adapt the core insight but change the form radically?" This friction is health. It means the concept has enough integrity to resist easy absorption, and the domain has enough strength to demand authenticity.

A second sign: the translation is flowing backward. Practitioners in the origin domain are reading what happened in the migration and saying, "We missed that. We assumed that. We should redesign our own practice." Corporate mentorship programs are being redesigned because someone brought government service pathway insights back home. Activist vocation mapping is being enriched because someone translated it into tech and discovered something about failure and learning that organizers needed to hear.

A third sign: new practitioners in the receiving domain are beginning to contribute to the concept's evolution rather than just consuming it. A government service designer is not simply using the migrated framework; she is extending it, naming insights that corporate contexts never had to surface. The concept has taken root and is beginning to bear fruit of its own.

**Signs of decay:**

The migrated concept is being treated as gospel — implemented with fidelity to the original form rather than adapted with integrity to the new domain. Government agencies are installing corporate mentorship programs wholesale, vocabulary and all, watching them wither because the structure does not fit, and blaming "government dysfunction" rather than asking what the migration taught them about their own constraints.

A second decay signal: the translation process is invisible. There is no journal, no documentation, no public record of what changed and why. The concept appears in the new domain as if it belonged there from the start, which means the next practitioner faces the same migration work in isolation. The commons learning is lost.

A third signal: the origin domain is indifferent or defensive about how the concept is being used elsewhere. Corporate practitioners see government's adaptation of career architecture and dismiss it as "not real career architecture," rather than asking what government learned that could make the corporate version more honest. When the flow stops, the concept begins to calcify.

**When to replant:**

If the migrated concept has been in place for 18–24 months and is generating ritual without genuine engagement, stop and redesign. Practitioners have learned the vocabulary but are no longer discovering. The timing is right to either deepen the concept's roots by reengaging with the origin domain's continued evolution, or to acknowledge that the transplant did not take and invest in a different approach.

If bidirectional translation has stopped — if the origin domain no longer learns anything from the migration — the pattern has lost its regenerative capacity. Replant by deliberately creating translation feedback loops: bring practitioners from both domains together, explicitly ask what each learned that surprises the other, and reinvest in the concept's evolution as a commons, not as a one-way transfer.
