Build capacity in service systems by training others, creating knowledge products, and documenting practice. Shift from individual provision to movement-building.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Capacity Building.

---

### Section 1: Context

You're in a system where knowledge, skill, or service delivery concentrates in a small group of practitioners. A few people know how to facilitate difficult conversations, navigate regulatory systems, build trust with communities, or solve recurring problems. The system grows dependent on their availability and burnout accelerates. Meanwhile, waiting lists grow. In activist movements, critical knowledge lives in a handful of organisers who can't be replicated. In government, retiring institutional memory creates service gaps. In corporate settings, expertise becomes scarce talent. In tech, tribal knowledge about user needs or system architecture stays locked in heads. The system is not fragmenting yet—it's functioning—but it's also not scaling its own resilience. Growth happens only at the pace of individual practitioners. The pattern emerges when you notice a painful choice: either accept stagnation or risk quality loss by rapid scaling. This is the moment to ask whether the knowledge and skill can be made into seeds—teachable practices, documented methods, transferable capability—that others can plant and tend.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Multiplying vs. Others.**

The tension appears as a collision between two legitimate needs: the impulse to scale impact (multiplying) and the commitment to honor the people being trained (others). 

On the multiplying side: you want impact to grow beyond your own hands. You want the work to survive your departure. You want to move from delivery to ecosystem. This impulse is vital—it's the only way a service system becomes resilient.

On the others side: training takes time away from direct service. It requires generosity—giving away hard-won knowledge. It risks diluting the quality of practice if trainees lack the judgment or context you carry. It can feel like replacing craftspeople with technicians. And if training is extracted from people without consent or reciprocity, it becomes exploitation.

The pattern breaks when either side wins completely. Multiplying without others breeds burnout and brittle expertise. Others without multiplying keeps the work marginal and dependent. The real failure is when training happens without building genuine ownership: you create trained staff, not practitioners. They follow the steps but don't understand the why. When conditions change, the system collapses because no one has learned to think.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, design and conduct deliberate training as an act of knowledge-making, where participants co-create documented practice while building the judgment required to adapt it.**

The mechanism here is a shift from *transfer* to *co-creation*. You're not pouring knowledge from one vessel to another. Instead, you're creating conditions where others learn your craft by doing it alongside you, while also making that craft visible, explicit, and improvable.

This works because it addresses both sides of the tension. On the multiplying side: when practice becomes documented—captured in guides, decision trees, case studies, recordings—it can be used and adapted far beyond your direct presence. A training program becomes a seed. On the others side: people in the training aren't passive recipients. They're makers. They bring their own context, questions, and improvements. They develop judgment by wrestling with real problems, not by memorizing steps.

The living systems language here matters. Seeds are dormant knowledge: a documented practice isn't alive until someone plants it, waters it, tends it. Roots are the judgment built through practice. Without roots, documented knowledge is just paper. The pattern grows roots when trainees don't just learn what to do, but develop the capacity to decide when, whether, and how to adapt it.

In Capacity Building tradition, this is sometimes called "train the trainer" work, but that phrase can hide shallow practice. Real capacity building means the trainer becomes more skillful through teaching—their knowledge deepens through the questions of others. It's reciprocal. The system's vitality increases not because more people can follow a script, but because more people can think in the domain.

---

### Section 4: Implementation

**Map the knowledge you're protecting.** Before training anyone, make explicit what lives only in your head. Set aside two hours. Name the practices, decision rules, judgment calls, and relationship patterns that make your work effective. Don't assume these are obvious. Often the most critical knowledge is invisible—how you decide when a client is ready for the next step, or which stakeholders to consult before a policy move. Write these down, even roughly.

**Design training as joint documentation.** Bring trainees into the practice *while* making the practice visible. Don't train in a classroom, then send people to work. Train in the actual ecology where the work happens. As you facilitate, pause to name what you're doing and why. Record this (video, notes, diagrams). Let trainees take notes, ask questions, argue with your choices. This creates a document that is both instruction and evidence—and trainees have ownership of it because they shaped it.

**Create knowledge products in multiple forms.** Different people learn differently. Some need video. Some need written guides with examples. Some need decision flowcharts. Some learn only by doing the work with your feedback. Build all of these. A well-resourced training program produces:
- Facilitation guides (step-by-step with decision points)
- Case studies from your own practice (real examples with analysis)
- Video or audio captures of actual work
- Decision trees for common situations
- A community forum where trainees can ask questions

**Establish feedback loops from practice to knowledge.** Training isn't one-way. After trainees begin working independently, they will find gaps in the guidance, discover new situations not covered in the documentation, improve methods. Create structured channels for this: monthly learning calls where trainees surface what didn't work; a shared repository where they can add cases and patterns they've discovered. This keeps the knowledge product alive. It also signals that you trust their judgment.

**Context translations—implement these specific moves:**

*Corporate:* Build internal training as a HR pipeline, but embed it in actual project teams. Pair each trainee with a senior practitioner for 6 months of real work, with monthly knowledge-building sessions where they document what they've learned. Create a searchable library of project case studies that new hires can reference. Make training part of performance metrics for experienced staff—it's not overhead, it's core work.

*Government:* Design training around the actual processes and regulations trainees will navigate. Include the uncertainty and contradiction they'll encounter. Partner with multiple agencies so trainees learn from each other's adaptations. Document not just the official policy, but the workarounds and judgment calls that actually make it work. Publish these guides on shared platforms—other governments can use and improve them.

*Activist:* Create "learning cells"—small groups (3–5) that meet regularly to practice the skill together, narrate what they're learning, and create shared resources (zines, videos, organizing guides). Train people while they're doing campaign work, not in isolation. Build feedback from the field directly into updates to training materials. Make training a cultural practice of the movement, not a one-time event.

*Tech:* Embed "learning by shipping" into development. New team members don't learn the system architecture in a course; they learn by building features alongside experienced engineers, with regular pairing sessions that also create documented decisions (design docs, architecture guides, recorded walkthroughs). Use version control not just for code but for documentation—capture the evolution of thinking. Treat your onboarding materials as a living product that improves each time someone new joins.

---

### Section 5: Consequences

**What flourishes:**

The system gains resilience. Knowledge no longer lives in scarce individuals. When a practitioner leaves, the work continues because others have learned not just the steps but the reasoning. You move from a bottleneck to an ecosystem. Trainees develop judgment and ownership, which means they don't just execute your way—they improve it. They make new combinations. The knowledge product becomes a commons: others can remix it, adapt it, share it with still others. Impact multiplies not linearly but exponentially. The original practitioner becomes freed to work on harder problems, innovation, or movement-building rather than service provision. Vitality increases because more people are thinking in the domain, not fewer.

**What risks emerge:**

Quality can decay if trainees lack the judgment to know when a practice should be adapted versus when it should be held. Documented knowledge can become dogma. Overtraining for scale can drain the original practitioners, creating the burnout they were trying to escape. Knowledge products can become outdated quickly if feedback loops aren't maintained—a guide written in 2022 may be misleading by 2024. The *Resilience* score (3.0) and *Ownership* score (3.0) are both below 4, signaling real vulnerabilities: if trainees are trained but don't have genuine decision-making power, they become functionaries, not stewards. The commons can fail to form. Most critically, watch for the *Stakeholder Architecture* score (3.0)—if trainers don't intentionally design shared governance of the knowledge product, it can revert to a top-down system where one person controls what counts as valid practice. Training can become a tool of control rather than liberation.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Doctors Without Borders and field training:** MSF operates in contexts where formal medical certification is impossible but the stakes of poor care are life-and-death. They built a practice of training local health workers not through short courses but through embedded mentorship in actual clinics. Senior medical staff work alongside trainees, pausing frequently to explain decisions. This practice is documented in clinical guides and case studies that are open-sourced. The consequence: in places like South Sudan and Syria, local health workers can provide primary care and refer complex cases with confidence. When MSF staff rotate, the care continues. The knowledge product—guides on trauma management, malnutrition, water safety in emergency contexts—is used by other NGOs and governments, multiplying impact far beyond MSF's direct presence.

**Labor organizing and organizer development:** The industrial labor movement in the 1970s–80s faced a crisis: organizers who could build rank-and-file power were aging out, and new organizers lacked the seasoned judgment. Some unions, particularly the Communication Workers of America, developed systematic "organizer schools" where experienced organizers didn't lecture but instead sat with trainees in actual union campaigns, discussing strategy choices in real time. They documented these conversations. The result: a generation of organizers developed judgment about when to escalate, when to negotiate, how to read power in a workplace. These practices were codified in training materials and playbooks that other unions adopted and adapted. The knowledge product became a commons within labor. Multiplying happened not through one person training many, but through many trainers using shared practices.

**Wikimedia and distributed knowledge-building:** The Wikimedia movement faced a challenge: how to train thousands of volunteer editors to maintain Wikipedia's quality standards without a centralized training apparatus? They designed a radically distributed model where experienced editors mentor new ones in actual article editing; every edit is documented and reviewable. The knowledge product isn't a course but the wiki itself—the best examples of good editing are visible, the talk pages show the reasoning. This meant quality multiplied not by training everyone identically, but by making practice transparent. Now volunteers in dozens of languages maintain similar quality standards because the practice is visible, improvable, and shared. The knowledge product is co-created by every contributor.

---

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an era of AI and distributed intelligence, this pattern shifts in two directions.

First, **AI can accelerate the codification phase**. An AI tool can help you make your knowledge explicit faster—transcribe your teaching sessions, identify recurring decision patterns, generate draft guides. You can feed recorded practices into a system that synthesizes them into multiple formats: video clips, text guides, decision trees. This is powerful. A practitioner who might have spent six months documenting practice can do it in weeks. The risk is shallow codification: the AI captures the surface moves without the judgment underneath. Mitigation: use AI as a scaffolding tool, but keep human review rigorous. The most critical knowledge often sounds like storytelling, not procedure.

Second, **AI can replace certain training functions but cannot replace judgment-building**. An AI tutor can answer questions about a documented practice instantly. It can generate variations on cases, provide feedback on decisions. This frees human trainers from information-transfer work to focus on mentorship, moral reasoning, and witnessing what the trainee actually does. The tech context translation (Multiplying Impact Through Training Others for Products) is particularly affected: onboarding new engineers to a codebase can partially be automated—an AI can explain code, trace dependencies, suggest reading. But it cannot teach you which decisions matter, why some tradeoffs exist, what the original authors were thinking about but didn't commit to code. That still requires a human who knows the system's genesis.

The deeper risk: in a Cognitive Era, training can become optimization instead of practice. You can measure engagement metrics and completion rates, but these don't measure judgment. You can scale training at a near-zero marginal cost, but this tempts you to assume the cost of building real ownership is gone. It's not. The commons assessment score of *Fractal Value* (4.5) is high—this pattern works across scales—but only if each scale maintains the reciprocity and co-creation. AI-mediated training risks becoming efficient but hollow.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of life:**

Trainees begin to improve the practice beyond where they learned it. They surface new cases, adapt the framework to their context, and these adaptations feed back into the shared knowledge product. You notice people who were trained are now training others, without your direct involvement—they're teaching using the guides, adding their own cases, building local ownership. The knowledge product is actually used: practitioners reference it under pressure, defend decisions by pointing to the documented reasoning. Feedback loops are flowing: you hear about failures and gaps in the guidance, and these become opportunities to deepen the documentation. The original practitioner is no longer the bottleneck for answers; they're focused on deepening practice alongside other experienced practitioners.

**Signs of decay:**

Trainees follow the documented practice without question, treating it as policy rather than craft. They can't adapt when conditions change. The knowledge product stops being updated—it becomes a static artifact that eventually becomes misleading. The original practitioner burnout hasn't decreased; instead, they're now also responsible for training, with no relief from delivery. People are trained in large groups, one-time events with no ongoing feedback. Training is seen as something done *to* people rather than *with* them. You notice that trained people leave the system or don't actually change their practice—they got certified but didn't develop ownership. The commons never forms; knowledge remains proprietary.

**When to replant:**

If you observe decay, pause training and audit the feedback loops. Did the knowledge product become dogma? Bring trainees back to co-create an updated version, using their field experience to refresh it. If training became a compliance checkbox rather than transformation, redesign to reduce class size and increase mentorship time. If the original practitioners are burned out, it's a sign you're training *instead of* redistributing the work—you need to give experienced trainees decision-making authority and reduce the load on originators. The right moment to restart training is when you can do it reciprocally: when trainees will also shape the knowledge product, when there's genuine shared governance, and when you've confirmed the feedback loops are real.
