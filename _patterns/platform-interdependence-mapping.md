Mapping one's network of platform relationships to understand systemic dependencies, single points of failure, and the collective governance implications of concentrated platform power.

> [!NOTE] Confidence Rating: ★★★ (Established)
> This pattern draws on Systems Thinking / Platform Studies.

### Section 1: Context

Most value creation now flows through platforms — digital or institutional — that practitioners and communities did not build and do not control. A coalition relies on email, cloud storage, and messaging apps owned by three corporations. A public agency discovers that its service delivery depends on APIs from private vendors. An activist network's reach depends on algorithmic curation it cannot see. These platforms are not neutral conduits; they are live organisms with their own incentives, vulnerabilities, and capacity to vanish or shift terms overnight.

The living ecosystem is one of creeping interdependence. Communities grow confident in these relationships — they become infrastructure — until a platform changes terms, gets acquired, experiences an outage, or deplatforms the user entirely. The system has developed roots into soil it does not own. Some practitioners sense this fragility; most do not until crisis hits. The commons layer remains invisible: no shared understanding of which dependencies are shared across the ecosystem, where single points of failure concentrate, or how platform power accumulates through opacity about these relationships.

This pattern addresses that blindness. It treats platform relationships as a mapping exercise — making the invisible network visible so practitioners can see where their autonomy is genuinely at risk and where collective action might reshape those relationships.

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Platform vs. Mapping.**

Platforms expand because they solve real problems: reach, coordination, ease. They are seductive precisely because they work well and hide their cost. The platform side of the tension pulls toward convenience, centralization, and growth. Mapping pulls toward visibility, decentralization, and deliberate choice.

The unresolved tension manifests as *cascading fragility*. A single platform failure (or policy shift) ripples through multiple communities because those communities have no shared picture of their mutual dependence. When Instagram's algorithm changed in 2022, thousands of creators and small businesses discovered simultaneously that their core channel no longer functioned — but they had no coordinated way to migrate, because no one had mapped the interdependence. The tension breaks into crisis.

Worse: practitioners often cannot articulate *why* they depend on a platform. Is it reach? Network effects? Technical lock-in? Cost? Habit? Without that clarity, they cannot distinguish which dependencies are necessary from which are optional — and therefore cannot negotiate with platforms or organize alternatives. The platform captures value not just through use, but through obscuring the architecture of dependence itself.

The mapping side of the tension insists on visibility. But visibility without collective action can paralyze: once you see the dependencies, the weight of them can feel immovable. A single organization mapping its platform dependencies is useful but limited. The real leverage emerges only when *multiple practitioners map together* — revealing shared single points of failure and creating negotiating power.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, conduct a collective network mapping of platform relationships, making explicit the dependencies, their criticality, their shared status, and the governance implications of that concentration.**

This pattern works by shifting from passive use to active cartography. You move from "we use these platforms" to "we are embedded in this specific architecture of dependence, and here is where it is fragile." The mechanism is clarification before action.

In living systems terms, you are creating a *diagnostic root system*. Just as a tree's roots sense where water is and where it is blocked, this mapping helps the commons sense where its autonomy is constrained and where it has actual agency. It reveals both the fungal networks that connect you to other practitioners (shared dependencies) and the parasitic relationships that weaken the whole system.

The mapping itself uses three layers, each one adding precision:

**Layer 1: Inventory.** What platforms does your community actually depend on? Not theoretically — what do you actively use, store data on, route communications through? This surfaces the buried dependencies: the Slack workspace that holds institutional memory, the Google Sheet tracking grants, the YouTube channel that reaches members, the payment processor you cannot live without.

**Layer 2: Interdependence.** Which of these platforms do *other communities in your network* also depend on? Where do your dependencies intersect? This is where the commons picture emerges. If five organizations all depend on the same email provider, they have collective leverage (and collective vulnerability).

**Layer 3: Criticality.** Which dependencies would actually break your work if removed? Rank them by impact (mission-critical, significant, convenient) and by replaceability (easily substituted, difficult but possible, locked-in). This strips away the assumption that all platform relationships are equivalent. Some are genuine structural necessities; others are habits.

The pattern draws from Systems Thinking (mapping feedback loops, identifying keystone variables) and Platform Studies (understanding how platforms concentrate power through lock-in, network effects, and data asymmetry). It borrows the practice of *supply chain mapping* from corporate resilience work and applies it to knowledge commons.

Once the map is visible, you can redesign. You can negotiate collectively from a position of shared knowledge. You can invest in alternatives for critical dependencies. You can reduce optional entanglements. The map itself is not the solution — it is the precondition for intelligent choice.

### Section 4: Implementation

**For Corporate Systems:** Conduct a formal platform dependency audit. Assign a small cross-functional team (IT, operations, communications, legal) to inventory all platforms in active use — including shadow IT your IT department may not track. Create a spreadsheet: platform name, function, criticality level (mission-critical/significant/convenience), number of users, data sensitivity, contract terms, lock-in risk, and owner's financial stability. Run this quarterly. Present it to leadership not as a compliance exercise but as a resilience inventory. This surfaces where enterprise risk concentrates (often in the assumption that a single cloud provider or communication platform is invincible) and where procurement can negotiate from collective knowledge.

**For Government Systems:** Map your agency's platform ecosystem explicitly, then share that map with peer agencies. You will discover that multiple agencies depend on the same vendor for case management, communications, or data storage — and that none of you knew it. Use this shared visibility to either negotiate collectively with vendors or, more powerfully, to justify investment in open-source alternatives. A city government that discovers three departments all use the same proprietary scheduling software has real leverage to demand open data exports or to fund an open alternative that benefits all three.

**For Activist Networks:** Build a "Movement Infrastructure Map" by asking: What platforms does our coalition use to organize, communicate, fundraise, and amplify? Map not just official channels but the informal ones — the private Signal groups, the WhatsApp networks, the shared documents where real decisions happen. Then ask: Who owns these? Who profits from our organizing? Which ones could disappear tomorrow? Use the map not as blame but as a conversation-starter about collective infrastructure. This often leads to decisions to invest in self-hosted platforms (a Matrix/Mastodon instance for the movement, a shared document repository) that the network controls directly.

**For Tech Teams:** Build a dependency graph tool into your platform architecture. Make it visible to users: "Your workspace depends on AWS (compute), Stripe (payments), SendGrid (email), Mapbox (mapping)." Show what happens when each dependency fails. Use this to justify investment in redundancy, federation, or open-source alternatives. A platform that shows users its own fragility builds trust and often triggers collective investment in resilience.

**Concrete workflow regardless of context:**

1. **Name the platforms** (30 minutes): List everything your community actively uses.

2. **Locate the dependencies** (1–2 hours): For each platform, note: What would break if it vanished? Who else in our network uses it? What data lives there?

3. **Map the intersections** (2–3 hours): Create a network diagram showing which platforms are shared across multiple teams or organizations. Use different colors for criticality level. This reveals where concentration is highest.

4. **Identify single points of failure** (1 hour): Which platforms, if removed, would cascade failure across multiple parts of the network? These are your leverage points — and your greatest vulnerabilities.

5. **Assess replaceability** (ongoing): For each critical dependency, research alternatives. Can you switch? What would it cost (money, time, learning curve)? This separates lock-in from necessity.

6. **Make governance decisions** (monthly or quarterly): Use the map to decide: Which dependencies do we accept? Which do we reduce? Where do we invest in alternatives? Which do we negotiate collectively?

### Section 5: Consequences

**What Flourishes**

Visibility creates agency. Once practitioners can see their interdependence, they can move from passive consumption to deliberate choice. This generates three concrete capacities:

*Collective negotiating power.* When five organizations realize they all depend on the same vendor, they can negotiate as a bloc — demanding better terms, open data exports, or service guarantees. Individual organizations have no leverage; networks have real power.

*Resilience capacity.* Mapping reveals where to invest in redundancy or alternatives. A coalition that understands its platform dependencies can decide: we will reduce our dependence on this one by 30% this year, by building an internal alternative. That is a measurable, achievable goal.

*Governance clarity.* The map becomes a living artifact that the commons can discuss and evolve. It shifts platform relationships from invisible infrastructure to deliberate choices that the community revisits regularly.

**What Risks Emerge**

*Analysis paralysis.* Seeing the full web of dependencies can feel overwhelming. Practitioners may respond by doing nothing — the interdependence feels immovable. The pattern is vulnerable to becoming a documentation exercise without action. Vitality reasoning notes that this pattern sustains existing health but does not necessarily generate new adaptive capacity — watch for maps that become shelf-ware.

*Resilience fragmentation.* Because resilience and autonomy score low (3.0), this pattern works best when the map is *collective*. Single-organization mapping often reveals that alternatives are too expensive or technically difficult for one actor alone. Without collective action, the individual organization has better visibility but no more power. The pattern can demoralize if it reveals dependencies but enables no alternatives.

*False symmetry.* Not all platforms are equally replaceable, and not all dependencies are equally voluntary. A payment processor is different from a communication tool. Mapping can flatten these differences — making it appear that all dependencies are equally optional. Practitioner judgment is required.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Case 1: The Fediverse Exodus, 2022–2023**

When Twitter's acquisition by Elon Musk raised concerns about platform stability and moderation, the tech and activist communities discovered something interesting: they had already mapped their alternatives. Mastodon, Bluesky, and other decentralized platforms existed not because anyone planned a migration strategy, but because communities had collectively recognized their Twitter dependence and (slowly, over years) built alternatives. The 2022 migration was large precisely because the work of mapping and relationship-building had happened quietly beforehand. Those who switched had already done the cognitive work of understanding their platform dependence. Those who did not switch had not; they remained locked in. The lesson: the network that maps its dependencies collectively has agency when crisis hits. Those that do not are helpless.

**Case 2: The UK Arts Council and Institutional Fragility, 2015**

The UK Arts Council discovered (through an informal mapping exercise) that dozens of arts organizations, museums, and cultural institutions shared dependence on a single email provider for their grant applications and reporting. When that provider had a 24-hour outage during a grant deadline, the entire funding process seized. This triggered a formal inventory of shared platform dependencies across the sector. It led to investment in open-source alternatives and redundancy. The map revealed not just a single point of failure but a pattern: the entire cultural sector had outsourced critical infrastructure to for-profit vendors without collective awareness. Sector-level mapping generated sector-level resilience investment.

**Case 3: Movement for Black Lives, 2020**

During the 2020 uprisings, the Movement for Black Lives and allied organizations used informal platform dependency mapping to navigate rapid crisis response. Teams asked: Where is our organizing happening? Who owns that space? What happens if we lose access? This led to quick decisions to migrate sensitive conversations to encrypted, self-hosted channels and to reduce dependence on platforms with known bias against Black activists (some platforms deprioritized protest content). The map was not comprehensive, but it was conscious. Organizations that had done this work moved faster and with more security than those that had not. The pattern proved vital not for predicting failure but for enabling rapid choice under pressure.

---

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age of AI and distributed intelligence, Platform Interdependence Mapping becomes simultaneously more urgent and more complex.

*Urgency increases* because AI systems introduce new invisible dependencies. You may depend not just on a platform itself but on the machine learning models that power its recommendations, moderation, or functionality. Those models are often proprietary and unstable — they are retrained, deprecated, or shifted without notice. A creator whose reach depends on an algorithm's behavior is now dependent on a system that is actively, dynamically changing. Mapping must now include: Which parts of this platform are human-controlled infrastructure, and which are AI-driven black boxes?

*Complexity multiplies* because AI enables platform consolidation at new scales. A single large model can power moderation, recommendation, and search across multiple platforms simultaneously. This creates hidden interdependence at a layer most practitioners cannot see. If a foundational model fails or shifts its behavior, it cascades across platforms that appear independent but share underlying AI infrastructure.

*New leverage emerges* around training data and fine-tuning. Increasingly, communities can now demand transparency about how AI models are trained on their data — and can threaten to withdraw that data if terms are unfair. Platform Interdependence Mapping in the AI era must include explicit questions: What data of ours is being used to train the models that power this platform? Do we control that? Can we revoke it?

*Distributed intelligence creates new options.* Open-source AI models (Llama, Mistral, local deployments) now enable communities to build platform-adjacent services without depending on proprietary vendors. A coalition could map its platform dependencies and then collectively invest in an AI-enabled alternative that is owned and controlled by the network. This was not possible five years ago.

The pattern must evolve: add a fourth layer to mapping called *Model Dependencies* — which tracks not just platform relationships but the AI systems embedded in them.

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of Life**

- The map is actively used in decision-making: platform choices are made by reference to the map, and the map is updated when new dependencies are added.
- Collective action follows from the map: the network has invested in reducing dependence on at least one critical platform (either by building an alternative or by negotiating collectively with the vendor).
- The map generates conversation across the network: teams discover shared dependencies they did not know about, and that discovery leads to new relationships and coordination.
- Resilience improves measurably: compare your platform redundancy and replaceability now versus before mapping. Is it better? If yes, the pattern is working.

**Signs of Decay**

- The map becomes archive rather than guide: it was created, added to a shared drive, and is never consulted again. It is documentation without action.
- Mapping fatigue sets in: the exercise becomes a quarterly checkbox that practitioners resent, because it reveals dependencies without enabling change.
- False clarity: the map exists, but practitioners still make individual platform choices as if the shared map does not exist. The map is visible but powerless.
- Concentration continues despite the map: you can see which platforms you are dependent on, but you have not invested in alternatives, and the dependencies keep growing.

**When to Replant**

Restart the mapping exercise when platform changes (new feature, acquisition, terms shift, outage) create urgency. Do not wait for crisis. Replant if the map is more than 18 months old, or if you have added more than three new critical platforms since the last mapping. The practice sustains existing health by keeping invisible infrastructure visible — but it requires regular renewal to stay alive.
