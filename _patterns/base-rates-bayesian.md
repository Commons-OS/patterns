### Section 1: Context

In organizations, governments, movements, and product teams, decision-makers face constant pressure to act on incomplete information. A hiring manager sees one strong interview. A public health official gets early signals of disease spread. An activist reads a viral post about a problem. A product team observes user churn in a cohort. Each person instinctively reaches for the most vivid, recent, or emotionally salient data point—and often ignores what's actually common in their domain.

The system is fragmenting: decisions split between those guided by statistical reality and those driven by narrative weight. A corporation making hiring decisions biased toward interview charisma (ignoring base rates of interview performance predicting actual job success) slowly decays its talent stock. A public health agency overreacting to one outbreak while ignoring the base rate of endemic disease wastes resources and erodes trust. Activist movements amplify outlier stories, losing sight of where energy actually shifts systems at scale. Product teams chase retention spikes driven by noise, missing the underlying base rate of user behaviour.

The healthy commons runs on shared, renewed understanding of what's actually common—not what feels true. This pattern cultivates that grounding. It asks: What is the baseline? What does new evidence actually change? Who holds both anchors in conversation together?

---

### Section 2: Problem

> **The core conflict is Base vs. Context.**

Base rates are abstract, statistical, often invisible—the actual frequency of a trait, outcome, or behaviour in a population. Context is vivid, particular, urgent—the specific case in front of you right now. They pull in opposite directions.

The base rate side says: "We hire 100 people a year. History shows that candidates who impress in interviews succeed at actual job performance only 40% of the time. That's your anchor." The context side says: "But *this person* was extraordinary in the room. The story they told was fresh. They showed something I've never seen before."

When base rates are ignored, the system decays quickly. Confirmation bias hardens—you notice only the vivid evidence that fits your snap judgment. Rare events get treated as probable. A single data breach at a competitor triggers panic spending on security; a base rate check reveals breaches happen to 1% of companies in your sector per year, yet you're budgeting as if they're imminent. Over time, decisions cluster around what feels recent and memorable rather than what's actually likely, and resources hemorrhage toward phantom threats.

But raw base rates without context-sensitivity create their own rot. A hiring manager who hires purely by statistical model misses genuine novelty and diversity. A public health system that ignores emerging outbreak patterns because "this disease is rare" gets blindsided. An activist movement that ignores a real shift in public sentiment because "history shows people don't change" ossifies.

The tension is real: base rates prevent catastrophic noise-chasing, but ignoring new context lets systems atrophy by missing genuine shifts.

---

### Section 3: Solution

> **Therefore, establish and renew a shared base rate map for your domain, then create continuous feedback loops where evidence visibly updates that map.**

This pattern works by making the invisible visible. Base rates are abstract until you name them and anchor them in your specific ecosystem. The solution has two roots:

*First, the map.* You excavate the true statistical ground of your domain. In hiring, you ask: "Across our last 200 hires, what predicts success—interview score, work sample, reference quality, diversity signals?" You build a living record. In public health, you maintain clear epidemiological data: "What's the baseline prevalence of disease X in our population? How does that change seasonally?" In activism, you measure: "What proportion of our public statements translate into concrete policy shifts? Which storytelling frames actually shift voter behaviour?" In product, you track: "What's the churn rate for new users by cohort? How does it normally evolve?"

This map is not static—it's a commons artifact that the whole system tends. It stays alive because practitioners renew it regularly with fresh data, surface it in decision moments, and treat updates as learning events rather than failures.

*Second, the feedback loop.* When a new case arrives, Bayesian reasoning starts: "Here's the base rate. Here's the new evidence. How much should that evidence shift our belief?" A hiring manager says, "The base rate for interview success is 40%. This candidate scored in the 90th percentile. That's 2.5 standard deviations above baseline. Our updated probability: maybe 65–70%." A health officer says, "Background infection rate is 0.1%. This cluster shows 10 cases. That's 100-fold higher. We update from 'unlikely' to 'active transmission happening now.'" The update is visible, shared, and testable.

The pattern sustains vitality not by generating new adaptive capacity, but by keeping the system's judgment organs working cleanly. It prevents both crisis-driven reactivity and comfortable stagnation. Over time, teams that practice this develop epistemic humility—they get better at knowing what they don't know.

### Section 4: Implementation

**For Corporate Contexts:**
Build a decision registry. Quarterly, collect decisions made (hiring, product launches, marketing spend). For each, document: the base rate used (or *not* used), the new evidence cited, and the actual outcome six months later. A tech company did this and discovered that hiring decisions ignoring their 40% interview-success base rate drifted toward charisma bias; once the rate was visible in hiring committee meetings, candidate selection shifted toward work samples. Post the base rate in your hiring rubric—not as law, but as the anchor point from which deviations must be explicitly argued.

**For Government Contexts:**
Establish a "base rate library" maintained by your analytical unit. Public health: baseline disease prevalence, seasonal patterns, demographic risk ratios. Criminal justice: baseline recidivism rates by crime type and demographics, historical clearance rates. Infrastructure: baseline failure rates for different asset classes. Require that policy proposals reference the base rate explicitly. When a mayor proposes a new crime initiative, the analysis must start: "Baseline burglary rate in our city is 150 per 100,000. We propose to reduce it to 100. Here's what evidence suggests is feasible." This grounds hope in reality.

**For Activist Contexts:**
Track what actually shifts systems. Many campaigns amplify stories that *feel* important (viral posts, individual rescues) while ignoring base rates of system change. Create a campaign analytics practice: "Of 50 direct actions we ran, how many led to policy meetings? Of those meetings, how many changed budgets?" One climate justice network discovered their base rate of converting a street action into a legislative win was 8%. They didn't abandon street action, but they stopped treating each march as equally impactful; they layered in base-rate-aligned tactics (long-term relationship building with legislators) where they'd been pure spectacle. The Bayesian update: "Spectacle alone reaches 80% of our base. Legislative wins are rare (8%). We need *both*."

**For Tech/Product Contexts:**
Instrument your product to make base rates visible. Set a dashboard showing: baseline churn rate by cohort, baseline session duration, baseline feature adoption for new users. When you ship a feature, the question isn't "Did it increase engagement?" but "By how much did it shift from baseline? Is the shift statistically significant at our base rate of variation?" A productivity app team noticed their base rate of feature adoption (30-day active use) was 15% across all new features. When they launched a collaboration tool, it hit 22%. That 7-point lift looked big until they checked: baseline variation was ±8 points. The tool was within noise. They iterated rather than shipping. Avoid the trap of treating every positive metric as a win if it's within normal system variance.

**Universal implementation step:** Monthly base rate review meetings. Bring together decision-makers, analysts, and practitioners. Spend 20 minutes on: "What base rates have we updated in the last month? What new evidence changed our models? What still feels vivid but isn't bearing out?" Make it a cadence, not a one-time audit.

### Section 5: Consequences

**What Flourishes:**

Teams practicing this pattern develop epistemic hygiene—a shared language for distinguishing signal from noise. Decision-making slows slightly but gets radically more accurate. A corporate hiring process becomes more diverse and more predictive. A public health response becomes more proportionate; resources flow to real risks rather than media-amplified fears. Activist campaigns compound: knowing your base rate of legislative wins, you can design campaigns that layer tactics with known efficacy, rather than hoping each action is a breakthrough. Product teams stop chasing every metric twitch and instead compound small, evidence-backed improvements into real advantage.

Trust increases because decisions become explicable. When a manager says, "We hired for diversity because the base rate of diverse teams outperforming homogeneous ones is 70%, and that's above our prior," that's defensible. When an activist says, "We're shifting from rallies to one-on-one voter contact because our base rate shows direct contact shifts votes 5× more than spectacle," people feel grounded.

**What Risks Emerge:**

The pattern can calcify. Teams begin treating base rates as law rather than useful anchors. ("The base rate says we'll fail, so we don't even try.") This kills innovation and adaptive response. Watch for hollow ritual: the base rate gets posted but not renewed; evidence doesn't actually update the map; decisions still run on gut feel while paying lip service to data. Resilience is at 3.0 partly because this pattern alone doesn't build adaptive capacity—it prevents bad decisions, but doesn't create new paths forward.

The pattern also risks becoming a tool for centralized control. If only data analysts hold base rates, practitioners lose autonomy to judge context. A hiring manager who can't override a base rate model becomes a function, not a partner. An activist losing flexibility to respond to emergent moments because "the base rate says we should…" becomes brittle.

There's also the measurement trap: if you can only fund what you can measure base rates for, you'll never try the unmeasurable. Some of the highest-leverage work (long-term culture change, relational trust) has weak base rate signals.

### Section 6: Known Uses

**Healthcare (Government/Public Service):**
The NHS in the UK maintains epidemiological base rates for common conditions—infection prevalence, treatment success rates, complication probabilities. When COVID emerged, they had a clear baseline (background respiratory disease prevalence, hospital capacity base rate) from which to update. Early models ignored that base rate and forecasted catastrophic demand; once integrated, predictions became tractable. The pattern worked: the update loop (case data → revised transmission estimates → updated forecasts) became the decision engine. Yet the pattern also showed its limits: early focus on the base rate of ventilator need (derived from Chinese data) caused oversupply of certain resources while other needs went unmet. Context mattered.

**Venture Capital (Corporate/Tech):**
Investors who track base rate return distributions outperform gut-feel investors significantly. Bessemer Venture Partners publishes their "Anti-Portfolio" (companies they rejected that later succeeded), making visible their base rate of rejections and the reasons. This honest tracking helps them update: early rejections of consumer tech now carry weight because the base rate of consumer tech success in their portfolio has risen. Newer VCs who skip this practice tend toward recency bias (chasing what just exited well) and narrative bias (investing in founders who tell good stories rather than founders whose backgrounds match success base rates).

**Criminal Justice (Government):**
The state of North Dakota built sentencing guidelines using base rates of recidivism by crime type, prior record, and demographics. Judges reference these guidelines (while retaining discretion to deviate with justification). The result: sentencing variation dropped from massive (similar crimes getting vastly different terms) to moderate. The system updated when recidivism data revealed new information (e.g., older offenders have lower recidivism than expected). This didn't eliminate injustice, but it made it visible—deviations from base rates became accountable.

---

### Section 7: Cognitive Era

In an age of machine learning and AI, base rates are simultaneously more critical and more at risk.

AI systems are Bayesian engines—they learn base rates at scale and update on evidence efficiently. A recommendation system learns the base rate of user engagement with different content types and updates that model millions of times per day. This is powerful: AI can track base rates humans can't perceive. A product team can now know, with certainty, that "users who complete onboarding have a 60% 30-day retention rate" versus "users who don't, 15%"—and that difference is real, not noise.

But AI also compounds base rate blindness. An algorithm learns the base rate of past hiring decisions (which embed historical bias) and replicates it, calling it prediction. A recommendation system learns that engagement-bait content gets clicks (the base rate) and amplifies it, even as it decays user trust (a slower-to-measure base rate). AI makes the invisible visible, but can also hide new failure modes behind statistical legitimacy.

The new challenge: whose base rates are in the system? A product recommendation algorithm trained on data from 2020 has learned a base rate that's already stale by 2024. An AI hiring tool learns the base rate of candidates who fit past success profiles—which may systematically exclude the kind of people you actually need now.

**Practitioner work shifts:** You must audit the base rates embedded in your AI systems. Ask: What distribution of outcomes was this model trained on? Has that distribution changed? What base rates are *not* being tracked because they're hard to measure (cultural contribution, long-term retention, psychological safety)? 

The leverage point: use AI to surface and renew base rates faster, but keep humans in the loop of Bayesian updating. Let the system propose: "Base rate of campaign success just shifted from 12% to 18% based on new audience data." Humans decide: "What does that tell us about our strategy?"

### Section 8: Vitality

**Signs of Life:**
- Base rates are visible, not hidden. You walk into a hiring meeting and see the 40% interview-success rate posted. You attend a campaign planning session and hear references to the base rate of policy wins. The data isn't secret; it's shared.
- Evidence actually updates models. When a new data point comes in, you see it shift the baseline. A public health team says, "We thought prevalence was 2%, but new serosurvey data shows 3.5%—we're updating our resource models." The map lives.
- Decisions reference both base rate and context. A hiring manager says, "The base rate is 40%, but this candidate has a rare credential that correlates with success—updating to 55%." The tension is *held*, not ignored.
- Practitioners feel empowered to challenge base rates. Someone says, "I think that base rate is outdated. Here's new evidence." The system responds by investigating, not defending.

**Signs of Decay:**
- Base rates are posted but frozen. A dashboard shows last year's numbers. No one has updated it in six months. It's become decoration.
- Decisions bypass the base rate. A manager says, "I know the base rate says 40%, but I *feel* this candidate is different." And no one asks: "Is the feeling based on new evidence, or narrative bias?" The pattern becomes hollow ritual.
- Context becomes an excuse for anything. Every outlier is treated as signal. A campaign that fails is said to have been "ahead of its time." Base rates are dismissed as irrelevant to "our unique situation."
- The system becomes rigid. Base rates are treated as law. "We can't hire above the 40% success threshold." Innovation grinds. The commons calcifies.

**When to Replant:**
Restart this practice when you notice decision quality declining—when projects fail more often, when resource allocation seems random, when teams argue past each other without shared ground. The moment to redesign is when the base rate map becomes so outdated that decisions made from it consistently miss reality. Bring together practitioners, analysts, and decision-makers. Ask: "What have we learned in the last year that should shift our base rates?" Rebuild the map from fresh data. Make it visible again. The pattern works only when it's alive—renewed, contested, and shared.
