### 1. Overview

The CIRCLES Method is a structured and systematic framework designed to guide product managers and designers through the process of responding to product design questions. Developed by Lewis C. Lin, a prominent author and expert in product management, the method provides a seven-step mnemonic that ensures a comprehensive and well-reasoned approach to problem-solving. The acronym CIRCLES stands for: Comprehend the situation, Identify the customer, Report the customer’s needs, Cut through prioritization, List solutions, Evaluate tradeoffs, and Summarize your recommendation. This methodical process helps to avoid common pitfalls such as jumping to solutions without a thorough understanding of the problem, the user, or the business context. By breaking down the complex process of product design into manageable steps, the CIRCLES Method empowers product professionals to deliver thoughtful, user-centric, and strategically aligned product proposals. It is particularly valued in high-pressure situations like product management interviews, where it serves as a reliable tool for structuring a coherent and compelling response. [1]

### 2. Core Principles

The CIRCLES Method is built upon a foundation of seven core principles, each represented by a letter in the acronym. These principles guide the product manager through a logical and comprehensive problem-solving journey, from initial understanding to a final, well-supported recommendation.

*   **Comprehend the Situation:** This initial step is about deeply understanding the problem at hand. It involves asking clarifying questions to grasp the context, constraints, and goals of the product design challenge. This principle emphasizes the importance of avoiding assumptions and building a solid foundation of knowledge before proceeding. [1]
*   **Identify the Customer:** At the heart of any successful product is a deep understanding of its users. This principle involves defining and characterizing the target customer or user persona. By creating a clear picture of who the product is for, their behaviors, and their motivations, product managers can ensure that the design is user-centric. [2]
*   **Report the Customer’s Needs:** Once the customer is identified, the next step is to articulate their pain points, desires, and needs. This is often done through the creation of user stories or use cases, which provide a clear and concise description of what the user wants to achieve. [3]
*   **Cut, Through Prioritization:** Not all customer needs are created equal. This principle involves prioritizing the identified needs based on factors such as their impact on the user, alignment with business goals, and feasibility of implementation. This ensures that the most critical problems are addressed first. [2]
*   **List Solutions:** With a clear understanding of the prioritized user needs, this step involves brainstorming a wide range of potential solutions. The emphasis is on creativity and generating a diverse set of ideas before narrowing down to the most promising ones. [3]
*   **Evaluate Tradeoffs:** Every solution comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. This principle involves a critical evaluation of the brainstormed solutions, weighing their pros and cons in terms of factors like cost, technical complexity, and user experience. This analytical approach ensures that the chosen solution is the most balanced and effective. [1]
*   **Summarize Your Recommendation:** The final step is to synthesize all the preceding analysis into a clear and concise recommendation. This involves summarizing the chosen solution, explaining the rationale behind the decision, and outlining the expected impact. A strong summary demonstrates a clear and confident thought process. [1]

### 3. Key Practices

The CIRCLES Method is not just a theoretical framework; it is a practical tool that involves a set of key practices at each stage. These practices help to ensure that the application of the method is thorough, insightful, and effective.

*   **Asking Clarifying Questions:** In the “Comprehend the Situation” phase, it is crucial to ask probing questions to uncover the underlying context. This includes the “3 W’s and H”: What is it? Who is it for? Why do they need it? and How does it work? This practice helps to avoid misunderstandings and ensures that the problem is well-defined from the outset. [3]
*   **Developing User Personas:** To “Identify the Customer,” creating detailed user personas is a key practice. This involves going beyond simple demographics to understand the user’s goals, motivations, and pain points. A well-developed persona serves as a constant reference point throughout the design process, ensuring that the user remains at the center of all decisions. [3]
*   **Crafting User Stories:** When “Reporting the Customer’s Needs,” the practice of writing user stories is highly effective. The format, “As a [type of user], I want [to perform some task] so that I can [achieve some goal],” helps to frame the user’s needs in a clear, concise, and actionable way. [3]
*   **Utilizing Prioritization Frameworks:** To “Cut, Through Prioritization,” employing established prioritization frameworks is a key practice. Frameworks such as RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) or a simple Frequency vs. Severity matrix provide a structured and objective way to rank user needs and features, ensuring that the most important items are addressed first. [2]
*   **Brainstorming and Ideation Techniques:** In the “List Solutions” phase, it is important to foster a creative and open environment for brainstorming. Techniques such as mind mapping, SCAMPER (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse), or simply generating a large quantity of ideas without initial judgment can lead to more innovative and effective solutions. [3]
*   **Conducting a Pro-Con Analysis:** When “Evaluating Tradeoffs,” a simple but powerful practice is to conduct a pro-con analysis for each potential solution. This involves listing the advantages and disadvantages of each option, which facilitates a clear and rational comparison. [1]
*   **Structuring a Compelling Narrative:** In the final “Summarize Your Recommendation” step, the key practice is to structure the recommendation as a compelling narrative. This involves not just stating the chosen solution, but also telling the story of how the decision was reached, highlighting the key insights and trade-offs that were considered. [1]

### 4. Application Context

The CIRCLES Method is most applicable in situations that require a structured and comprehensive approach to product design and problem-solving. It is particularly well-suited for the following contexts:

*   **Product Management Interviews:** The framework was originally developed as a tool to help candidates excel in product management interviews, where they are often presented with open-ended product design questions. Its structured nature allows candidates to demonstrate a clear, logical, and user-centric thought process under pressure.
*   **New Product Development:** When embarking on the development of a new product or feature, the CIRCLES Method provides a valuable roadmap for the initial stages of discovery and definition. It ensures that the product team has a thorough understanding of the problem, the user, and the market before committing to a specific solution.
*   **Product Redesign and Improvement:** The framework is also highly effective for redesigning or improving existing products. By systematically working through the seven steps, product teams can identify the most impactful areas for improvement and develop solutions that address real user needs.
*   **Cross-Functional Alignment:** The CIRCLES Method can serve as a valuable tool for facilitating discussions and aligning stakeholders from different teams (e.g., engineering, marketing, sales). Its clear and logical structure provides a common language and framework for discussing product decisions.

However, the CIRCLES Method may be less suitable for situations that require rapid, iterative decision-making, such as in the early stages of a startup where a “lean startup” approach of building, measuring, and learning may be more appropriate. Additionally, for very simple or well-defined problems, the full seven-step process may be overly prescriptive.

### 5. Implementation

Implementing the CIRCLES Method involves a step-by-step application of its seven principles. The following is a detailed guide to implementing the framework, using the example of a product design question: “How would you design a smart bed?” [4]

**1. Comprehend the Situation:**
Start by asking clarifying questions to understand the context. For example:
*   “Is this a new product for an existing company, or a new startup?”
*   “What is the primary goal of this product? (e.g., increase revenue, enter a new market, improve user health)”
*   “Are there any technical or resource constraints I should be aware of?”

**2. Identify the Customer:**
Next, identify the potential user segments for a smart bed. These could include:
*   **The Health-Conscious Professional:** A busy individual who wants to optimize their sleep for better performance.
*   **The Elderly User:** An individual who needs to monitor their health and safety during sleep.
*   **The Tech-Savvy Couple:** A couple who enjoys using technology to improve their lifestyle.

Choose one persona to focus on, for example, the Health-Conscious Professional.

**3. Report the Customer’s Needs:**
Now, articulate the needs of the Health-Conscious Professional in the form of user stories:
*   “As a health-conscious professional, I want to track the quality of my sleep so that I can make adjustments to my routine for better rest.”
*   “As a health-conscious professional, I want to wake up feeling refreshed and energized so that I can be more productive during the day.”
*   “As a health-conscious professional, I want to understand how my daily activities affect my sleep so that I can improve my overall well-being.”

**4. Cut, Through Prioritization:**
Prioritize these needs based on their importance to the user. For the Health-Conscious Professional, tracking sleep quality and waking up refreshed are likely the most critical needs.

**5. List Solutions:**
Brainstorm potential solutions to address these prioritized needs:
*   **Integrated Sleep Tracking:** Sensors in the mattress that monitor heart rate, respiratory rate, and movement.
*   **Smart Alarm:** A feature that wakes the user up during their lightest sleep phase within a set window.
*   **Personalized Sleep Coaching:** An accompanying app that provides insights and recommendations based on the user’s sleep data.
*   **Climate Control:** The ability to adjust the temperature of the bed for optimal sleep.

**6. Evaluate Tradeoffs:**
Evaluate the pros and cons of each solution:
*   **Integrated Sleep Tracking:** High value to the user, but may have privacy concerns.
*   **Smart Alarm:** Relatively simple to implement and provides a clear benefit.
*   **Personalized Sleep Coaching:** High potential for user engagement, but requires sophisticated algorithms.
*   **Climate Control:** A premium feature that could significantly increase the cost of the bed.

**7. Summarize Your Recommendation:**
Finally, summarize your recommendation. For example:
“My recommendation is to design a smart bed that focuses on the core needs of the Health-Conscious Professional. The initial product would include integrated sleep tracking and a smart alarm feature. This combination provides a strong value proposition by helping users to both understand and improve their sleep. In the future, we could expand the product to include personalized sleep coaching and climate control as premium features.”

### 6. Evidence & Impact

The CIRCLES Method has had a significant impact on the field of product management, particularly in the context of interviews and early-stage product development. Its primary evidence of impact lies in its widespread adoption and endorsement by product management professionals and educators.

*   **Industry Adoption:** Many leading tech companies, including Google, Amazon, and Facebook, use product design questions in their interviews, and the CIRCLES Method has become a standard framework for candidates to prepare for these interviews. The method’s creator, Lewis C. Lin, has coached countless candidates who have successfully landed jobs at these companies. [3]
*   **Educational Value:** The CIRCLES Method is taught in numerous product management courses and workshops, and is featured in many popular books and blogs on the topic. Its clear and memorable structure makes it an effective tool for teaching the fundamentals of product design thinking. [2]
*   **Real-World Application:** While the CIRCLES Method is most famously associated with interviews, its principles are also applied in real-world product development. For example, the development of Google Assistant involved a deep understanding of the market context and user needs, similar to the “Comprehend the Situation” and “Identify the Customer” steps of the framework. Similarly, Netflix’s sophisticated audience segmentation and personalized recommendations are a testament to the power of identifying and reporting on customer needs. [2]

However, the CIRCLES Method is not without its limitations. Some critics argue that its linear and prescriptive nature can stifle creativity and lead to a “cookie-cutter” approach to problem-solving. Others have pointed out that the framework may not be as effective in complex, real-world situations where problems are often ambiguous and ill-defined. Despite these criticisms, the CIRCLES Method remains a valuable and widely used tool for product managers, providing a solid foundation for structured and user-centric product design. [5]

### 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

In the Cognitive Era, characterized by the rise of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data, the CIRCles Method remains relevant, but its application can be enhanced and adapted to leverage these new technologies.

*   **Data-Driven Customer Identification and Needs Reporting:** In the Cognitive Era, the processes of identifying customers and reporting their needs can be significantly augmented by data. Instead of relying solely on qualitative personas, product managers can now leverage large datasets and machine learning algorithms to identify user segments and uncover hidden needs and patterns of behavior. This allows for a more nuanced and evidence-based understanding of the customer.
*   **AI-Powered Solution Generation and Evaluation:** The brainstorming and evaluation of solutions can also be enhanced by AI. Generative AI models can be used to brainstorm a wider range of potential solutions, while machine learning models can be used to predict the potential impact and feasibility of each solution. This can help to accelerate the ideation process and lead to more innovative and effective solutions. [3]
*   **Personalization at Scale:** The Cognitive Era enables a new level of personalization that was not possible before. The CIRCLES Method can be used to design products that are not just user-centric, but also adaptive and personalized to the individual user. For example, a smart bed designed using the CIRCLES Method could use machine learning to learn the user’s sleep patterns and automatically adjust its settings for optimal comfort and sleep quality.
*   **Ethical Considerations:** The use of AI and big data also raises new ethical considerations that must be taken into account when applying the CIRCLES Method. Issues such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the potential for manipulation must be carefully considered and addressed throughout the design process.

In summary, the Cognitive Era does not render the CIRCLES Method obsolete, but rather provides new opportunities to enhance its application. By integrating AI, machine learning, and big data into the framework, product managers can develop more intelligent, personalized, and impactful products. [5]

### 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

The CIRCLES Method, as a problem-solving framework, has a mixed alignment with the principles of a Commons-based approach. While it promotes a structured and user-centric design process, its primary focus is on creating successful products within a market-based economy, rather than on fostering a collaborative and shared resource.

**Alignment with Commons Principles:**

*   **User-Centricity:** The method’s strong emphasis on identifying and addressing user needs aligns with the Commons principle of being community-driven. By placing the user at the center of the design process, the CIRCLES Method helps to ensure that the resulting product is valuable and relevant to its users.
*   **Transparency and Logic:** The framework’s structured and transparent process promotes a clear and logical approach to decision-making. This can help to foster trust and understanding among stakeholders, which is a key element of a healthy Commons.

**Misalignment with Commons Principles:**

*   **Focus on Competition and Market Success:** The CIRCLES Method is ultimately a tool for achieving success in a competitive market. Its goal is to create products that will outperform competitors and generate revenue. This focus on competition and commercial success is at odds with the Commons principle of collaboration and shared value.
*   **Lack of Emphasis on Community Contribution:** The framework does not explicitly encourage or facilitate community contribution to the design process. While it emphasizes understanding the user, it does not provide a mechanism for users to actively participate in the creation and governance of the product.
*   **Proprietary Nature:** The CIRCLES Method itself is a proprietary framework, trademarked by its creator. This is in direct contrast to the Commons principle of open and shared knowledge.

**Overall Assessment:**

The CIRCLES Method can be a useful tool for developing user-centric products, but it is not inherently aligned with a Commons-based approach. To better align the method with Commons principles, it would need to be adapted to include a greater emphasis on community collaboration, open governance, and shared ownership. For example, the “Identify the Customer” step could be expanded to include a process for engaging the community in a co-design process. Similarly, the “Summarize Your Recommendation” step could include a plan for how the product will be governed and maintained as a shared resource.
