### 1. Overview

A Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) is a highly automated and integrated production system capable of producing a variety of parts or products with minimal setup time and human intervention. It combines the flexibility of a job shop with the efficiency of a transfer line, enabling manufacturers to respond quickly to changes in market demand, product design, and production volume. The core of an FMS lies in its ability to reconfigure its resources—including computer-controlled machines, automated material handling systems, and a central control computer—to produce different items within a product family. This adaptability is what distinguishes FMS from traditional mass production systems, which are typically designed for high-volume, low-variety manufacturing.

The primary value of FMS is its capacity to enhance both productivity and agility. By automating many of the manual and repetitive tasks involved in production, FMS significantly reduces lead times, labor costs, and the potential for human error. This increased efficiency does not come at the expense of flexibility; on the contrary, FMS allows for the production of a wide range of products in small to medium-sized batches, a key advantage in today's fast-paced and highly customized markets. The concept of FMS emerged in the mid-20th century, with early patents for automated production systems filed by British inventor Theo Williamson in the 1960s. However, it was not until the 1970s and 1980s, with the advent of more powerful computers and robotics, that FMS became a practical reality for manufacturers. Since then, the technology has continued to evolve, driven by advances in digital technology, and is now a cornerstone of modern manufacturing in industries ranging from automotive to aerospace.

FMS creates value in several ways. For the **manufacturer**, it creates economic value by increasing productivity, reducing costs, and improving quality. For the **customer**, it creates value by providing a wider range of products to choose from, and by enabling the customization of products to meet their specific needs. For **employees**, FMS can create value by providing them with the opportunity to develop new skills in areas like robotics and data analysis. However, it can also lead to job displacement for low-skilled workers.

**3. Value Preservation:**

The core principle of FMS is flexibility, which is key to its ability to preserve value over time. By being able to adapt to changes in product design, production volume, and market demand, FMS can remain relevant and productive for many years. The modular design of many FMS also allows for easy upgrades and the integration of new technologies as they become available. This ensures that the system can continue to evolve and meet the changing needs of the market.

**4. Shared Rights & Responsibilities:**

In a traditional FMS, the rights and responsibilities are typically concentrated in the hands of the owners of the manufacturing company. They own the assets of the FMS and make the key decisions about its operation. However, there is a growing recognition that a more commons-aligned approach to FMS, with more shared ownership and governance, could lead to better outcomes for all stakeholders. This could involve giving employees a greater say in the operation of the FMS, or creating partnerships with suppliers and customers to share the risks and rewards of the system.

**5. Systematic Design:**

FMS is a highly systematic and integrated system. It is composed of a number of interconnected subsystems, including computer-controlled machines, an automated material handling system, and a central control computer. The design of an FMS requires a systematic approach to ensure that all of the components work together seamlessly. This includes a thorough analysis of the manufacturing process, the selection of the right technologies, and the development of a detailed implementation plan.

**6. Systems of Systems:**

An FMS is a system of systems. It is composed of a number of individual machines and subsystems that are integrated to work together as a single, cohesive unit. The FMS itself is also part of a larger system of systems, which includes the company's enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, its supply chain management (SCM) system, and its product lifecycle management (PLM) system. The successful integration of all of these systems is essential for the effective operation of the FMS.

**7. Fractal Properties:**

The principles of FMS exhibit fractal properties, as they can be applied at different scales. At the smallest scale, a single machine can be seen as a flexible manufacturing cell (FMC). At a larger scale, a number of FMCs can be integrated to form a flexible manufacturing system. At an even larger scale, a number of FMS can be networked together to create a flexible manufacturing network. The same principles of flexibility, automation, and integration apply at all of these scales.
