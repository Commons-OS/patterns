# Privacy, Security & Sovereignty Patterns for Commons OS

## Project Overview

This research project identifies proven and emerging patterns for building **resilient value creation systems** that are not compromised by privacy, security, or data vulnerabilities. 

**Core Principle**: This is not about protecting data from specific nations or actors — it's about **designing systems that are architecturally resilient to compromise**, regardless of threat origin.

## Why This Matters for Commons OS

The Convergence Imperative means:
- Value creation systems increasingly depend on data flows, AI integration, and cross-border collaboration
- A commons that can be surveilled, manipulated, or shut down by external actors isn't truly resilient
- As boundaries dissolve, attack surfaces expand
- The 7 Pillars (especially Resilience) require specific privacy/security architectural patterns

## Pattern Categories

### 1. Privacy Patterns
Patterns for protecting individual and collective data while enabling value creation.
- Data minimization
- Consent architecture
- Anonymization & pseudonymization
- Federated learning
- Zero-knowledge proofs
- Differential privacy
- Privacy by design

### 2. Security Patterns
Patterns for protecting systems from unauthorized access, manipulation, and disruption.
- Defense in depth
- Least privilege
- Secure by design
- Supply chain integrity
- Zero trust architecture
- Cryptographic patterns
- Incident response patterns

### 3. Sovereignty Patterns
Patterns for maintaining control and independence in a multi-jurisdictional world.
- Data localization alternatives
- Multi-jurisdiction resilience
- Vendor independence
- Open standards adoption
- Interoperability patterns
- Exit strategy patterns
- Distributed governance

### 4. AI-Specific Patterns
Patterns for the unique privacy/security challenges of AI-integrated systems.
- Model governance
- Inference privacy
- Training data provenance
- Algorithmic transparency
- AI supply chain security
- Federated AI
- On-device inference

## Research Approach

1. **Identify proven patterns** — Documented in academic literature, industry standards, and regulatory frameworks
2. **Identify emerging patterns** — From cutting-edge research, startup innovations, and forward-thinking organizations
3. **Assess Commons OS relevance** — Using the 7 Pillars framework to evaluate each pattern's contribution to collective value creation
4. **Create documentation backlog** — Prioritized list ready for full pattern documentation

## Relationship to Existing Commons OS Patterns

These patterns will be documented in the same format as Business Commons patterns:
- 8-section structure with Section 8 (Commons OS Assessment) using the 7 Pillars
- Cross-references to related Business Commons patterns where applicable
- New domain: "Security" (alongside Business, Urban, Ecology, Life)

## EU as Case Study (Not Role Model)

The EU regulatory environment (GDPR, Digital Services Act, AI Act) provides useful case studies:
- Some patterns emerge from compliance requirements
- But regulatory compliance ≠ good pattern design
- Focus on *architectural patterns* that achieve the goals, not *compliance checklists*

**Project Status**: Documentation complete
**Patterns Identified**: 120 patterns across 4 categories
**Patterns Documented**: 98 (82% coverage)
**Remaining**: 22 highly specialized/emerging patterns in backlog
