# Solidarity Economy - Alternative Paradigm

## 1. Overview

The Solidarity Economy, also referred to as the Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE), represents a transformative economic framework that prioritizes social and environmental objectives over the singular pursuit of financial profit. It is a global movement and a practical approach to organizing economic activity that is rooted in values of solidarity, cooperation, democracy, equity, and sustainability. Unlike the mainstream capitalist economy, which is driven by competition and individual gain, the Solidarity Economy is built on a foundation of interdependence and collective well-being.

A key distinguishing feature of the Solidarity Economy is its emphasis on participatory and democratic governance. In contrast to hierarchical corporate structures, organizations within the Solidarity Economy are typically characterized by inclusive decision-making processes where all stakeholders, including workers, consumers, and community members, have a voice. This commitment to democratic governance is not merely a procedural formality; it is a fundamental mechanism for empowering individuals and communities as active agents in shaping their economic lives.

The Solidarity Economy is not a monolithic model but rather a diverse and evolving ecosystem of economic practices and institutions. It encompasses a wide range of activities, from worker cooperatives and community land trusts to fair trade networks and complementary currencies. These diverse initiatives are united by a shared commitment to creating a more just, equitable, and sustainable world. While some proponents of the Solidarity Economy seek to create alternatives to capitalism, others focus on "humanizing" the existing system by creating community-based safety nets and promoting ethical business practices.

## 2. Core Principles

The Solidarity Economy is guided by a set of core principles that distinguish it from the mainstream, profit-driven economy. These principles are not merely abstract ideals but are actively put into practice through the diverse range of organizations and initiatives that make up the Solidarity Economy. While the specific emphasis may vary across different contexts, the following principles are central to the Solidarity Economy movement:

*   **Solidarity and Cooperation:** At the heart of the Solidarity Economy is the principle of solidarity, which emphasizes mutual support, cooperation, and a sense of shared responsibility. This stands in contrast to the individualism and competition that characterize the mainstream economy. Solidarity is expressed through practices such as resource sharing, mutual aid, and collaborative decision-making.

*   **Equity and Justice:** The Solidarity Economy is committed to promoting social, economic, and environmental justice. This includes addressing systemic inequalities based on race, class, gender, and other forms of marginalization. Solidarity Economy initiatives strive to create a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities, and to empower marginalized communities.

*   **Democracy and Participation:** Democratic governance and participatory decision-making are fundamental to the Solidarity Economy. This means that all stakeholders, including workers, consumers, and community members, have a meaningful voice in the decisions that affect them. This principle is put into practice through structures such as cooperatives, community assemblies, and participatory budgeting processes.

*   **Sustainability and Ecological Responsibility:** The Solidarity Economy recognizes the interdependence of human well-being and the health of the planet. It promotes sustainable practices that respect ecological limits and seek to regenerate natural systems. This includes a focus on local production and consumption, renewable energy, and the responsible stewardship of natural resources.

*   **Pluralism and Diversity:** The Solidarity Economy is not a one-size-fits-all model. It is a pluralistic and diverse movement that embraces a wide range of approaches and practices. This diversity is seen as a source of strength and resilience, allowing the Solidarity Economy to adapt to different cultural, social, and economic contexts.

## 3. Key Practices

The Solidarity Economy is not just a set of abstract principles; it is a vibrant and diverse field of practice. Across the globe, communities are developing and implementing innovative economic models that embody the values of the Solidarity Economy. These practices are not isolated experiments but are often interconnected, forming a resilient and self-reinforcing network of alternative economic activity. The following are some of the key practices that are commonly associated with the Solidarity Economy:

*   **Cooperatives:** Cooperatives are businesses and organizations that are owned and democratically controlled by their members. There are many different types of cooperatives, including worker cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, producer cooperatives, and housing cooperatives. Cooperatives are a cornerstone of the Solidarity Economy, as they provide a model for democratic governance and equitable distribution of surplus.

*   **Community Land Trusts (CLTs):** CLTs are non-profit, community-based organizations that acquire and hold land for the benefit of the community. By taking land off the speculative market, CLTs can ensure that it is used for affordable housing, community gardens, and other community-serving purposes. CLTs are a powerful tool for combating gentrification and promoting community control over land.

*   **Fair Trade:** Fair trade is a trading partnership, based on dialogue, transparency, and respect, that seeks greater equity in international trade. It contributes to sustainable development by offering better trading conditions to, and securing the rights of, marginalized producers and workers. Fair trade is a way of connecting consumers with the producers of their food and goods, and of ensuring that trade has a positive social and environmental impact.

*   **Complementary Currencies:** Complementary currencies are forms of money that are designed to be used alongside conventional, government-issued currency. They can be used to promote local economic development, build community, and encourage more sustainable patterns of consumption. Examples of complementary currencies include time banks, local exchange trading systems (LETS), and regional currencies.

*   **Participatory Budgeting:** Participatory budgeting is a democratic process in which community members directly decide how to spend part of a public budget. It is a way of giving citizens a direct say in the decisions that affect their lives, and of making government more transparent and accountable. Participatory budgeting has been implemented in cities and towns around the world, and has been shown to be an effective tool for promoting civic engagement and social equity.

## 4. Application Context

The Solidarity Economy is not a utopian ideal but a practical framework that is being applied in a wide variety of contexts around the world. It is particularly relevant in situations where the mainstream economy has failed to meet the needs of people and the planet. The Solidarity Economy provides a framework for building more resilient, equitable, and sustainable communities from the ground up.

*   **Community Development:** The Solidarity Economy is a powerful engine for community-led development. By creating locally-owned businesses and services, communities can create jobs, build wealth, and meet their own needs without relying on outside corporations or government agencies. This is particularly important in low-income communities and communities of color that have been historically marginalized by the mainstream economy.

*   **Social and Economic Inclusion:** The Solidarity Economy provides a pathway to economic inclusion for individuals and groups that are often excluded from the mainstream economy. This includes low-wage workers, immigrants, and people with disabilities. By creating worker cooperatives and other forms of democratic enterprise, the Solidarity Economy can provide decent work and economic opportunity for all.

*   **Post-Crisis Recovery:** The Solidarity Economy has proven to be a resilient and effective model for post-crisis recovery. In the wake of natural disasters, financial crises, and other shocks, communities have turned to the Solidarity Economy to rebuild their lives and livelihoods. The decentralized and democratic nature of the Solidarity Economy makes it well-suited to responding to the specific needs of a community in crisis.

*   **Urban and Rural Contexts:** The Solidarity Economy is being implemented in both urban and rural contexts. In cities, it is taking the form of urban farms, community land trusts, and neighborhood-based businesses. In rural areas, it is being used to support small-scale farmers, create local food systems, and promote sustainable rural development.

## 5. Implementation

Implementing the Solidarity Economy is not a simple matter of following a blueprint. It is a dynamic and emergent process that requires creativity, collaboration, and a deep understanding of the local context. However, there are a number of key steps and strategies that can help to guide the implementation process.

*   **Mapping and Assessment:** The first step in implementing the Solidarity Economy is to map the existing economic assets and activities in a community. This includes identifying existing cooperatives, community-based organizations, and other forms of solidarity economic activity. This mapping process can help to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for collaboration.

*   **Education and Capacity Building:** Building a Solidarity Economy requires a significant investment in education and capacity building. This includes providing training on topics such as cooperative development, democratic governance, and financial management. It also involves raising awareness about the principles and practices of the Solidarity Economy among the general public.

*   **Building Networks and Alliances:** The Solidarity Economy is a networked movement. It is built on relationships of trust and collaboration between individuals, organizations, and communities. Building strong networks and alliances is essential for sharing resources, knowledge, and best practices. It is also crucial for building the collective power needed to challenge the dominant economic system.

*   **Policy and Advocacy:** While the Solidarity Economy is a grassroots movement, it can be significantly supported by a favorable policy environment. This includes policies that support the development of cooperatives, community land trusts, and other forms of solidarity economic activity. It also involves advocating for changes to the legal and regulatory framework to create a more level playing field for the Solidarity Economy.

## 6. Evidence & Impact

While the Solidarity Economy is a relatively new field of study, there is a growing body of evidence that demonstrates its positive social, economic, and environmental impacts. This evidence comes from a variety of sources, including academic research, case studies, and the lived experiences of communities that are practicing the Solidarity Economy.

*   **Economic Impact:** The Solidarity Economy has a significant economic impact, particularly at the local and regional levels. Cooperatives and other forms of social enterprise create jobs, generate income, and build community wealth. For example, a 2019 study by the International Co-operative Alliance found that the top 300 cooperatives in the world have a combined turnover of over USD 2 trillion. In addition, the Solidarity Economy can help to stabilize local economies and make them more resilient to external shocks.

*   **Social Impact:** The social impacts of the Solidarity Economy are perhaps even more significant than its economic impacts. The Solidarity Economy is a powerful tool for building social cohesion, promoting civic engagement, and empowering marginalized communities. By creating spaces for democratic participation and collective action, the Solidarity Economy can help to build a more just and equitable society. For example, a study of participatory budgeting in Porto Alegre, Brazil, found that it led to a significant increase in citizen participation and a more equitable distribution of public resources.

*   **Environmental Impact:** The Solidarity Economy is also having a positive impact on the environment. By promoting local production and consumption, supporting sustainable agriculture, and encouraging the use of renewable energy, the Solidarity Economy is helping to build a more sustainable and resilient economy. For example, a study of community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs in the United States found that they can significantly reduce food miles and promote more sustainable farming practices.

## 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

The transition to the Cognitive Era, characterized by the rise of artificial intelligence, big data, and the platform economy, presents both significant challenges and profound opportunities for the Solidarity Economy. The same technologies that are driving the gig economy and exacerbating economic inequality can also be harnessed to build a more democratic, equitable, and sustainable economy.

*   **Platform Cooperativism:** One of the most promising developments at the intersection of the Solidarity Economy and the Cognitive Era is the emergence of platform cooperativism. Platform cooperatives are online platforms (websites or mobile apps) that are owned and governed by their users, workers, and other stakeholders. They offer a powerful alternative to the extractive model of venture capital-backed platforms like Uber and Airbnb. By putting people before profit, platform cooperatives can create more equitable and sustainable livelihoods for platform workers and users.

*   **Data as a Commons:** In the Cognitive Era, data has become a valuable resource. The Solidarity Economy offers a framework for treating data as a commons, to be managed and governed for the collective benefit of all. This stands in contrast to the dominant model of corporate data extraction and surveillance. By creating data commons, communities can harness the power of data to address social and environmental challenges, while protecting individual privacy and autonomy.

*   **AI and Automation for the People:** Artificial intelligence and automation have the potential to either displace workers and concentrate wealth, or to free humanity from drudgery and create a more abundant and equitable society. The Solidarity Economy provides a framework for ensuring that these powerful technologies are developed and deployed in a way that serves the common good. This includes exploring models of community-owned AI and automation, and investing in education and training to ensure that everyone has the skills to thrive in the Cognitive Era.

*   **Digital Democracy and Governance:** The Cognitive Era is also creating new opportunities for democratic governance and participation. Online platforms and tools can be used to facilitate more inclusive and participatory decision-making processes, from the workplace to the community to the nation-state. The Solidarity Economy is at the forefront of experimenting with these new forms of digital democracy, from online assemblies to participatory budgeting platforms.

## 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

The Solidarity Economy is deeply aligned with the principles of the commons. It offers a powerful framework for building and sustaining a wide range of commons, from natural resource commons to knowledge commons to social commons. The following table provides an assessment of the Solidarity Economy's alignment with seven key dimensions of the commons:

| Dimension | Alignment | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **Shared Resources** | High | The Solidarity Economy promotes the creation and stewardship of a wide range of shared resources, including land, housing, food, and knowledge. Practices such as community land trusts and data commons are explicit attempts to decommodify resources and manage them for the collective good. |
| **Community Governance** | High | Democratic governance and participatory decision-making are at the heart of the Solidarity Economy. It provides a framework for communities to self-organize and govern their own economic lives, which is a core principle of the commons. |
| **Social Equity** | High | The Solidarity Economy is explicitly committed to social and racial justice. It seeks to empower marginalized communities and to create a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities. This aligns with the commons principle of ensuring that all members of a community have access to the resources they need to thrive. |
| **Ecological Sustainability** | High | The Solidarity Economy recognizes the interdependence of human well-being and the health of the planet. It promotes sustainable practices that respect ecological limits and seek to regenerate natural systems. This is essential for the long-term viability of any commons. |
| **Openness & Knowledge Sharing** | High | The Solidarity Economy is a networked movement that thrives on the open sharing of knowledge and best practices. It is a learning movement that is constantly evolving and adapting to new challenges and opportunities. This commitment to openness and collaboration is a hallmark of the commons. |
| **Decommodification** | High | The Solidarity Economy challenges the logic of the market and seeks to decommodify goods, services, and social relations. It provides a framework for meeting human needs outside of the cash nexus, which is a core principle of the commons. |
| **Reproduction of the Commons** | High | The Solidarity Economy is not just about creating individual commons; it is about creating a self-reproducing ecosystem of commons. By building networks of solidarity and cooperation, the Solidarity Economy can create a virtuous cycle of commons-building that can challenge the dominance of the state and the market. |
