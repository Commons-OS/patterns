### 1. Overview

Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) is a framework that guides innovators to create products and services that customers will want to buy. The central idea is that customers don’t buy products; they “hire” them to get a “job” done. This “job” is the progress that a person is trying to make in a particular circumstance. By understanding the job, companies can design solutions that are more likely to be successful in the marketplace.

The theory was popularized by Clayton Christensen, a Harvard Business School professor, and is a powerful tool for understanding customer motivation. It shifts the focus from demographics and product attributes to the customer's underlying needs and goals. This allows for a more precise understanding of what causes customers to make the choices they do. The core problem that JTBD solves is the high failure rate of innovation. By focusing on the job, companies can reduce the guesswork and create products that people will actually use.

The origin of the theory can be traced back to the work of Christensen and his colleagues, as well as practitioners like Tony Ulwick of Strategyn. It emerged from the observation that successful innovations are those that help customers make progress in their lives. The theory provides a lens for seeing the world from the customer’s perspective, which is essential for creating truly innovative and valuable products and services.

### 2. Core Principles

1.  **People hire products to get a job done.** This is the foundational principle of the theory. Customers are not buying a product for its features, but for the progress it helps them make in their lives. This shift in perspective is crucial for understanding customer motivation.

2.  **Jobs are about progress, not tasks.** A job is the emotional and social progress a person is trying to make, not just the functional task they are trying to complete. Understanding the full context of the job, including the desired emotional and social outcomes, is key to creating a successful solution.

3.  **The job, not the customer, is the unit of analysis.** Instead of focusing on customer demographics, the JTBD framework focuses on the job the customer is trying to get done. This allows for a more precise understanding of customer needs and a more effective approach to innovation.

4.  **Circumstances are more important than customer characteristics.** The context in which a customer is trying to get a job done is a better predictor of their behavior than their demographic profile. Understanding the circumstances that trigger the need for a solution is essential for designing a product that will be hired.

5.  **Competition is defined by the job.** From the customer's perspective, any product that can help them get the job done is a competitor. This includes products from different categories and even non-consumption. This broader view of competition is essential for understanding the full range of options available to the customer.

### 3. Key Practices

1.  **Job Mapping:** This practice involves breaking down the customer’s job into a series of discrete steps. By understanding the entire process the customer goes through to get the job done, companies can identify opportunities to help them at each step. A typical job map includes the following stages: define, locate, prepare, confirm, execute, monitor, modify, and conclude.

2.  **Outcome-Driven Innovation (ODI):** Developed by Tony Ulwick, ODI is a systematic process for applying the JTBD framework. It involves identifying the customer’s desired outcomes for a particular job and then using that information to guide the innovation process. The goal is to create products and services that help customers achieve their desired outcomes better than any competing solution.

3.  **The “Switch” Interview:** This is a qualitative research technique used to uncover the forces that cause a customer to switch from one product to another. By understanding the push of the situation, the pull of the new solution, the habit of the present, and the anxiety of the new, companies can gain deep insights into the customer’s decision-making process.

4.  **Identifying Unmet Needs:** A key practice in JTBD is to identify the customer’s unmet needs. These are the desired outcomes that are important to the customer but are not well-satisfied by existing solutions. By focusing on unmet needs, companies can create products and services that have a high likelihood of success.

5.  **Value Proposition Design:** The JTBD framework is a powerful tool for designing compelling value propositions. By understanding the customer’s job, pains, and gains, companies can create value propositions that resonate with customers and clearly articulate how their product or service will help them get the job done better.

### 4. Application Context

**Best Used For:**

*   **New Product or Service Development:** The JTBD framework is ideal for identifying unmet customer needs and developing new solutions that address them. It helps companies create products that customers will actually want to buy.
*   **Improving Existing Products:** By understanding the job the customer is trying to get done, companies can identify opportunities to improve their existing products and make them more valuable to the customer.
*   **Market Segmentation:** The JTBD framework can be used to segment the market based on the different jobs that customers are trying to get done. This allows for more targeted marketing and product development efforts.
*   **Marketing and Sales:** By understanding the customer’s job, marketing and sales teams can create more effective messaging and positioning that resonates with the customer’s needs and motivations.
*   **Disruptive Innovation:** The JTBD framework is a powerful tool for identifying opportunities for disruptive innovation. By understanding the job, companies can create new solutions that are simpler, more affordable, and more convenient than existing alternatives.

**Not Suitable For:**

*   **Incremental Improvements:** While JTBD can be used to improve existing products, it is not the best framework for making small, incremental improvements. The framework is most powerful when it is used to create new and innovative solutions.
*   **Cost-Cutting Initiatives:** The JTBD framework is focused on creating value for the customer, not on cutting costs. While cost savings may be a byproduct of a successful JTBD initiative, it should not be the primary goal.

**Scale:**

The Jobs-to-be-Done framework can be applied at any scale, from the **individual** to the **ecosystem** level. It can be used by individual entrepreneurs to develop new products, by teams to improve existing products, by departments to develop new services, by organizations to drive innovation, and by multiple organizations to collaborate on new solutions.

**Domains:**

The JTBD framework is applicable across a wide range of industries, including:

*   **Technology:** Software, hardware, and consumer electronics.
*   **Healthcare:** Medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and healthcare services.
*   **Financial Services:** Banking, insurance, and investment services.
*   **Consumer Goods:** Food and beverage, personal care, and household products.
*   **Education:** K-12, higher education, and corporate training.

### 5. Implementation

Successfully implementing the Jobs-to-be-Done framework requires a shift in mindset and a structured approach. It is not a quick fix, but a long-term commitment to understanding and serving the customer.

**Prerequisites:**

Before embarking on a JTBD initiative, it is essential to have a few key things in place. First, there must be strong leadership support. The JTBD framework challenges many traditional business practices, and it is essential to have leaders who are willing to champion the new approach. Second, there must be a cross-functional team that is dedicated to the initiative. The team should include representatives from product development, marketing, sales, and customer support. Finally, there must be a willingness to invest in customer research. The JTBD framework is built on a deep understanding of the customer, and it is essential to have the resources to conduct the necessary research.

**Getting Started:**

Once the prerequisites are in place, there are a few concrete steps that companies can take to get started with the JTBD framework. First, select a market to focus on. It is best to start with a market that is well-understood and where there is a clear opportunity for improvement. Second, conduct customer research to understand the job the customer is trying to get done. This can be done through a variety of methods, including interviews, surveys, and observation. Third, create a job map to visualize the steps the customer goes through to get the job done. This will help to identify opportunities for innovation. Fourth, identify the customer’s unmet needs. These are the desired outcomes that are important to the customer but are not well-satisfied by existing solutions. Finally, brainstorm new solutions that address the unmet needs. This is where the real innovation happens.

**Common Challenges:**

There are a few common challenges that companies face when implementing the JTBD framework. First, it can be difficult to get buy-in from stakeholders who are used to more traditional approaches to product development. Second, it can be challenging to conduct the necessary customer research. It takes time and resources to do it right. Third, it can be difficult to translate the insights from the research into new product ideas. It requires a creative and disciplined approach. Finally, it can be difficult to measure the success of a JTBD initiative. The benefits are often long-term and difficult to quantify.

**Success Factors:**

Despite the challenges, there are a few key factors that can contribute to the success of a JTBD initiative. First, it is essential to have a clear and compelling vision for the initiative. This will help to get buy-in from stakeholders and keep the team motivated. Second, it is important to have a dedicated and cross-functional team that is empowered to make decisions. Third, it is essential to have a deep understanding of the customer. This can only be achieved through rigorous customer research. Finally, it is important to have a culture of experimentation and learning. The JTBD framework is not a linear process, and it is important to be willing to iterate and adapt along the way.

### 6. Evidence & Impact

The Jobs-to-be-Done framework has been adopted by a wide range of companies, from startups to Fortune 500 corporations. The framework has been credited with helping companies to develop more successful products, improve their marketing and sales efforts, and drive innovation.

**Notable Adopters:**

*   **Microsoft:** The company has used the JTBD framework to develop new products and improve existing ones, including its Office suite and a number of its hardware products.
*   **Bosch:** The German engineering and technology company has used the JTBD framework to develop new power tools and other products.
*   **Arm & Hammer:** The consumer goods company has used the JTBD framework to develop new cat litter products.
*   **Intercom:** The customer messaging platform has built its entire product development process around the JTBD framework.
*   **Netflix:** The streaming giant used JTBD to understand that their competition wasn't just other streaming services, but anything that helped people relax and unwind, including a glass of wine or a good book.

**Documented Outcomes:**

While it can be difficult to quantify the exact financial impact of the JTBD framework, there is a growing body of evidence that it can lead to significant business results. For example, a study by Strategyn found that companies that use its Outcome-Driven Innovation process are five times more likely to have a successful new product launch. Another study, by the Clayton Christensen Institute, found that companies that use the JTBD framework are more likely to create disruptive innovations.

**Research Support:**

The Jobs-to-be-Done framework is supported by a growing body of academic research. In addition to the work of Clayton Christensen, a number of other researchers have studied the framework and its application in a variety of industries. This research has helped to validate the core principles of the framework and to provide a deeper understanding of how it can be used to drive innovation.

### 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

The principles of Jobs-to-be-Done are timeless, but their application is evolving in the cognitive era. The rise of artificial intelligence and automation presents both new opportunities and new challenges for the JTBD framework.

**Cognitive Augmentation Potential:**

AI and automation can be used to augment the JTBD framework in a number of ways. For example, AI-powered tools can be used to analyze large amounts of customer data to identify unmet needs and to generate new product ideas. Machine learning algorithms can be used to personalize the customer experience and to provide more targeted solutions. And chatbots and other conversational interfaces can be used to provide more efficient and effective customer support.

**Human-Machine Balance:**

As AI and automation become more prevalent, it is important to strike the right balance between human and machine. While AI can be a powerful tool for innovation, it is not a substitute for human creativity and empathy. The most successful companies will be those that are able to combine the power of AI with the insights and intuition of their human employees. The uniquely human aspects of the JTBD process, such as conducting “switch” interviews and understanding the emotional and social dimensions of a job, will become even more important in the cognitive era.

**Evolution Outlook:**

In the future, we can expect to see the JTBD framework continue to evolve. As AI and other new technologies emerge, there will be new opportunities to apply the framework in new and innovative ways. For example, we may see the development of new tools and methods for conducting customer research, for analyzing customer data, and for generating new product ideas. We may also see the emergence of new business models that are based on the principles of the JTBD framework. The core principles of the framework, however, will remain the same. The focus on understanding the customer’s job and on creating solutions that help them make progress will continue to be the key to success in the cognitive era.

### 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

The Jobs-to-be-Done framework, while primarily a tool for commercial innovation, has interesting implications when viewed through the lens of a commons-based approach. Its focus on deep-seated human needs rather than transient wants offers a potential bridge between market-driven product development and the creation of shared, sustainable value.

1.  **Stakeholder Mapping:** The framework inherently focuses on the “customer” as the primary stakeholder. However, a commons-aligned approach would expand this to include all those affected by the job and the solutions created for it. This includes employees, suppliers, the community, and the environment. A more holistic application of JTBD would map the jobs of all stakeholders, not just the end-user.

2.  **Value Creation:** JTBD is excellent at creating functional, emotional, and social value for the individual customer. However, a commons approach would also consider the creation of social and ecological value. For example, a solution that helps a customer get a job done but also creates a large amount of waste would be seen as a net negative from a commons perspective.

3.  **Value Preservation:** The framework’s focus on the job, which is stable over time, is a strong point of alignment with the commons principle of value preservation. By focusing on the underlying need, companies can create solutions that are more resilient to technological change and that can be adapted and evolved over time.

4.  **Shared Rights & Responsibilities:** In its traditional application, the JTBD framework does not explicitly address the distribution of rights and responsibilities. However, a commons-aligned approach would seek to create solutions that are more open, participatory, and equitable. This could include open-sourcing the design of a product, creating a platform for co-creation, or sharing the profits with the community.

5.  **Systematic Design:** The Outcome-Driven Innovation process is a highly systematic approach to innovation. This aligns well with the commons principle of systematic design. However, a commons-aligned approach would also consider the design of the larger system in which the product or service is embedded. This includes the social, economic, and ecological systems.

6.  **Systems of Systems:** The JTBD framework can be used to understand how different products and services can be combined to create a more complete solution. This aligns with the commons principle of systems of systems. A commons-aligned approach would seek to create solutions that are interoperable and that can be combined in new and innovative ways to create even more value.

7.  **Fractal Properties:** The core principles of the JTBD framework can be applied at any scale, from the individual to the ecosystem. This aligns with the commons principle of fractal properties. A commons-aligned approach would seek to create solutions that are scalable and that can be adapted to different contexts.

**Overall Score: 3 (Transitional)**

The Jobs-to-be-Done framework is a powerful tool for innovation that has the potential to be aligned with the principles of the commons. However, in its current form, it is still primarily a tool for commercial innovation. To be fully commons-aligned, the framework would need to be expanded to include a more holistic view of value creation, a more explicit focus on shared rights and responsibilities, and a more systematic approach to designing for the commons.

**Opportunities for Improvement:**

*   Expand the definition of “customer” to include all stakeholders.
*   Incorporate social and ecological value into the value proposition.
*   Design for openness, participation, and equity.
*   Consider the larger system in which the product or service is embedded.
*   Create solutions that are interoperable and that can be combined in new and innovative ways.
