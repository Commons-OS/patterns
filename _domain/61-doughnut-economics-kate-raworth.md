### 1. Overview (150-300 words)

Doughnut Economics is a groundbreaking economic model and framework developed by British economist Kate Raworth. It redefines the goal of economics, moving away from the endless pursuit of GDP growth towards a more holistic objective: meeting the needs of all people within the means of the living planet. The model is visualized as a doughnut, with a social foundation of well-being that no one should fall below, and an ecological ceiling of planetary boundaries that humanity should not overshoot. The space between these two rings is the “safe and just space for humanity.”

The core problem Doughnut Economics addresses is the inherent unsustainability and inequality of the current economic system. It provides a compelling alternative to the prevailing economic paradigm, which has led to severe environmental degradation and social disparities. By offering a clear and intuitive visual framework, it empowers policymakers, businesses, and communities to design and implement more regenerative and distributive economic strategies.

The concept was first introduced by Kate Raworth in a 2012 Oxfam report, “A Safe and Just Space for Humanity.” It was further elaborated in her 2017 book, “Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist.” The model has since gained international recognition and is being adopted by cities, regions, and organizations worldwide as a tool for sustainable development.

### 2. Core Principles (3-7 principles, 200-400 words)

Doughnut Economics is built upon seven core principles that challenge traditional economic thinking and provide a new framework for the 21st century.

1.  **Change the Goal.** The primary objective of economic activity should not be the endless pursuit of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, but rather to achieve a balance between meeting the needs of all people and protecting the planet. This means shifting the focus from a quantitative goal to a qualitative one: creating a safe and just space for humanity to thrive.

2.  **See the Big Picture.** The economy is not a separate, self-contained system, but is deeply embedded within society and the natural world. This principle calls for a holistic view that recognizes the interdependence of the economy, society, and the environment, and the need to manage the economy in a way that respects social and ecological boundaries.

3.  **Nurture Human Nature.** The traditional economic model is based on a narrow and inaccurate view of human nature, portraying people as rational, self-interested, and insatiable consumers. Doughnut Economics recognizes that humans are social, cooperative, and adaptable beings, and that economic systems should be designed to nurture these aspects of our nature.

4.  **Get Savvy with Systems.** The economy is a complex, dynamic, and unpredictable system, not a simple, linear machine. This principle encourages a systems-thinking approach that embraces complexity, feedback loops, and uncertainty, and that seeks to build resilience and adaptability into the economic system.

5.  **Design to Distribute.** The current economic system is designed to concentrate wealth and power in the hands of a few. Doughnut Economics calls for a more distributive design, where value is shared more equitably among all stakeholders. This can be achieved through a variety of mechanisms, such as employee ownership, fair taxation, and investment in public services.

6.  **Create to Regenerate.** The industrial economy has been based on a degenerative model of “take, make, use, lose,” which has led to widespread environmental degradation. Doughnut Economics advocates for a regenerative approach, where economic activity is designed to restore and replenish natural resources, rather than deplete them. This involves shifting to a circular economy, where waste is minimized and resources are reused and recycled.

7.  **Be Agnostic about Growth.** Doughnut Economics recognizes that growth is a natural and healthy phase of development, but that nothing grows forever. Instead of being addicted to growth, we should be agnostic about it, and focus on creating economies that thrive, whether or not they are growing.

### 3. Key Practices (5-10 practices, 300-600 words)

The principles of Doughnut Economics are put into action through a variety of practices that can be adapted to different contexts, from cities to businesses.

1.  **Downscaling the Doughnut.** This involves translating the global Doughnut into a local context, such as a city or region. This process, known as creating a "City Portrait," involves a participatory approach where local stakeholders identify their social and ecological priorities. For example, the city of Amsterdam created its own City Doughnut to guide its post-pandemic recovery, focusing on areas like affordable housing, sustainable food systems, and a circular economy.

2.  **Doughnut Unrolled.** This is a workshop methodology that helps organizations and communities explore the implications of the Doughnut for their own operations and strategies. It involves a deep dive into the five design lenses of Purpose, Networks, Governance, Ownership, and Finance, to identify opportunities for transformative change. For instance, a business might use this process to rethink its ownership structure to better align with its social and environmental goals.

3.  **Data Portrait of a Place.** This practice involves gathering and visualizing data to create a comprehensive picture of a place's performance against the social and ecological goals of the Doughnut. This data-driven approach helps to identify key challenges and opportunities, and to track progress over time. The city of Brussels, for example, has developed a detailed data portrait to inform its transition to a Doughnut economy.

4.  **Community-Led Workshops.** These are workshops and events organized by local communities to learn about the Doughnut and to co-create solutions for their own context. These grassroots initiatives are a key part of the Doughnut Economics movement, as they empower citizens to take ownership of their collective future. In the UK, numerous community groups have organized Doughnut workshops to explore issues such as local food systems, renewable energy, and community wealth building.

5.  **Business Design for the Doughnut.** This involves applying the principles of Doughnut Economics to the design of businesses. This means moving beyond the traditional focus on maximizing profits to a more holistic approach that considers the well-being of all stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, and the environment. The Doughnut Economics Action Lab (DEAL) provides tools and resources to help businesses on this journey, such as the “Doughnut Design for Business” tool.

6.  **Policy and Governance Innovation.** This practice involves developing new policies and governance structures that support the transition to a Doughnut economy. This can include things like new forms of taxation, regulation, and public investment that incentivize regenerative and distributive practices. For example, the city of Nanaimo in Canada has integrated the Doughnut into its strategic planning processes.

7.  **Educational Initiatives.** This involves integrating the concepts of Doughnut Economics into educational curricula at all levels, from primary schools to universities. This is crucial for building the knowledge and skills needed to create a new generation of economic thinkers and practitioners. The DEAL website features a wide range of educational resources, including lesson plans, videos, and games.

### 7. Cognitive Era Considerations (200-400 words)

- **Cognitive Augmentation Potential**: Artificial intelligence and automation can significantly enhance the implementation of Doughnut Economics. AI-powered data analytics can be used to create more sophisticated and dynamic “data portraits” of cities and regions, providing real-time insights into social and ecological performance. Machine learning algorithms can help to identify complex interconnections and feedback loops within the economic system, enabling more effective and targeted interventions. For example, AI could be used to optimize supply chains for circularity, or to develop personalized education programs that promote sustainable lifestyles.

- **Human-Machine Balance**: While AI can be a powerful tool for analysis and optimization, the transition to a Doughnut economy is ultimately a human endeavor. The process of setting social and ecological goals, of co-creating solutions, and of building a shared vision for the future requires empathy, creativity, and collaboration – qualities that are uniquely human. The role of technology should be to augment, not replace, human intelligence and agency. It is crucial to ensure that the development and deployment of AI is guided by ethical principles and a commitment to social and ecological well-being.

- **Evolution Outlook**: In the cognitive era, the Doughnut model is likely to evolve in several ways. We can expect to see the development of more sophisticated and interactive digital tools for exploring and applying the Doughnut. The integration of AI and blockchain technologies could enable new forms of decentralized and democratic governance, allowing for more transparent and accountable decision-making. The Doughnut could also become a key framework for guiding the development of artificial general intelligence, ensuring that these powerful new technologies are aligned with the long-term interests of humanity and the planet.

### 8. Commons Alignment Assessment (600-800 words)

1.  **Stakeholder Mapping**: Doughnut Economics excels in its comprehensive and inclusive approach to stakeholder mapping. It fundamentally challenges the narrow, shareholder-centric view of traditional economics by explicitly considering the well-being of all stakeholders. This includes not only employees, customers, and suppliers, but also the wider community, future generations, and the living world. The practice of creating a “City Portrait” is a powerful example of this, as it involves a participatory process where diverse voices from across a city are brought together to co-create a shared vision for their future. This inclusive approach is also reflected in the core principles of “seeing the big picture” and “nurturing human nature,” which call for a holistic and empathetic understanding of the complex web of relationships that make up our economies and societies.

2.  **Value Creation**: The framework is designed to create a wide range of value beyond the purely financial. It prioritizes the creation of social value, such as equity, social justice, and human well-being, and ecological value, such as a stable climate, healthy oceans, and thriving biodiversity. The ultimate goal is to create a “safe and just space for humanity,” where both people and the planet can thrive. The principles of “designing to distribute” and “creating to regenerate” are central to this vision, as they call for a fundamental redesign of our economies to be more equitable and sustainable.

3.  **Value Preservation**: The Doughnut model is designed to be a dynamic and evolving framework that can maintain its relevance over time. The principle of being “agnostic about growth” is key to this, as it shifts the focus from the short-term pursuit of endless growth to the long-term goal of creating a thriving and resilient economy. The emphasis on systems thinking and continuous learning also allows the framework to adapt to changing circumstances and to incorporate new knowledge and insights. The Doughnut Economics Action Lab (DEAL) plays a crucial role in this process, by fostering a global community of practice and by supporting the ongoing development and refinement of the Doughnut model.

4.  **Shared Rights & Responsibilities**: The framework promotes a sense of shared responsibility for our collective future. It empowers citizens to take an active role in shaping their economies through participatory processes like community-led workshops and the creation of City Portraits. The principle of “being distributive” also extends to the distribution of rights and responsibilities, by calling for more equitable and democratic forms of governance. This is a significant departure from the traditional economic model, which tends to concentrate power and decision-making in the hands of a few.

5.  **Systematic Design**: Doughnut Economics is a deeply systemic framework. It provides a set of tools and methodologies for redesigning our economies from the ground up. The “five design lenses” of Purpose, Networks, Governance, Ownership, and Finance provide a systematic framework for analyzing and transforming organizations and economies. The “Doughnut Unrolled” methodology and the “City Portrait” process are concrete examples of the systems and processes that enable the implementation of the framework.

6.  **Systems of Systems**: The Doughnut is a meta-pattern that can be composed with a wide range of other patterns and frameworks. It provides a high-level vision and a set of guiding principles that can be used to inform the application of other approaches, such as the circular economy, community wealth building, and platform cooperativism. The framework’s emphasis on “seeing the big picture” and “thinking in systems” makes it naturally compatible with other systemic and holistic approaches to social and economic change.

7.  **Fractal Properties**: The Doughnut model is explicitly designed to be fractal, meaning that its principles can be applied at all scales, from the individual and household level to the global level. The framework has been successfully applied at the city, regional, and community level, and there are ongoing efforts to apply it at the national and international level. The core principles of the Doughnut are universal, but they can be adapted to different contexts and scales, making it a highly versatile and adaptable framework.

**Overall Score**: 4/5 (Commons-Aligned)

Doughnut Economics is a powerful and transformative framework that is deeply aligned with the principles of the commons. It provides a compelling vision for a more just and sustainable world, and a practical set of tools and methodologies for getting there. While the framework is still relatively new and its long-term impact is still being evaluated, it has already inspired a global movement of cities, communities, and organizations that are working to put its principles into practice. The main opportunity for improvement is to continue to build the evidence base for the framework’s effectiveness and to develop more robust and scalable models for its implementation.
