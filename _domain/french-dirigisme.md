# French Dirigisme

## 1. Overview

French Dirigisme is an economic framework where the state plays a highly influential and directive role in the nation's economy. This approach, which gained prominence in the post-World War II era, is characterized by a strong partnership between the government and private industry, with the state guiding investment, fostering national champions, and using indicative planning to steer economic development. While not a centrally planned economy, Dirigisme represents a significant departure from laissez-faire capitalism, emphasizing state intervention to correct market failures, promote strategic industries, and ensure long-term economic stability and growth. [1] [2]

## 2. Core Principles

The core principles of French Dirigisme are rooted in the belief that the state has a vital and proactive role to play in guiding economic development. These principles, which distinguish Dirigisme from both laissez-faire capitalism and centrally planned economies, include the state as a strategic actor, pragmatic interventionism, public-private partnership, and the promotion of national champions. The state is not merely a regulator but an active participant in the economy, setting long-term goals and directing investment to achieve them. This involves a strategic vision for the nation's economic future, with the government identifying key industries and sectors for development. Dirigisme is characterized by a pragmatic approach to market intervention. The state intervenes to correct perceived market failures, to nurture infant industries, and to ensure that economic activities align with national interests. This intervention is not based on a rigid ideology but on a practical assessment of what is needed to achieve economic objectives. The framework is built on a close collaboration between the state and private enterprise. The government works with businesses to guide their investment decisions, providing them with incentives, financial support, and a stable environment for growth. This partnership is intended to be mutually beneficial, with the state helping businesses to become more competitive and businesses contributing to the nation's economic development. A key element of Dirigisme is the promotion of "national champions" – large, state-supported companies that are expected to compete on the global stage. These companies, often in strategic sectors like aerospace, energy, and transportation, benefit from preferential treatment and are seen as instruments of national economic power. [1] [2]

## 3. Key Practices

French Dirigisme is implemented through a set of distinctive practices that translate its core principles into action. These practices include indicative planning, state ownership and control, control over credit, and technocratic governance. Indicative planning is the cornerstone of Dirigisme. The government, through institutions like the *Commissariat général du Plan*, creates multi-year plans that outline the country's economic priorities and investment targets. These plans are not legally binding but serve as a powerful signal to both public and private actors, guiding their decisions and coordinating their activities. The state maintains significant ownership stakes in key industries, either directly or through state-owned enterprises. This allows the government to exert direct control over strategic sectors of the economy, ensuring that they operate in the national interest. The state exercises considerable influence over the financial system, directing credit to favored industries and companies. This is a powerful tool for steering investment and promoting the development of strategic sectors. The implementation of Dirigisme is entrusted to a cadre of elite civil servants, or "technocrats," who are trained in prestigious institutions like the École Nationale d'Administration (ENA). These technocrats, who often move between high-level positions in government and industry, play a crucial role in formulating and executing economic policy. [2] [4]

## 4. Application Context

French Dirigisme emerged in the specific historical and economic context of post-World War II France. The country was devastated by the war, with its infrastructure and industrial base in ruins. There was a strong political consensus that a new approach to economic management was needed to rebuild the country and to ensure its future prosperity and security. The pre-war economic model, characterized by a fragmented and often inefficient private sector, was seen as inadequate to the task of reconstruction. This created a fertile ground for a more interventionist approach, with the state taking a leading role in a national effort to modernize the economy. The Cold War also played a significant role in the adoption of Dirigisme. The desire to maintain national independence and to build a strong industrial base as a bulwark against both American and Soviet influence was a powerful motivator. Dirigisme was seen as a "third way" between the perceived excesses of American-style capitalism and the rigidities of Soviet-style communism. [1] [5]

## 5. Implementation

The implementation of French Dirigisme was a complex and multifaceted process, involving a range of institutions and policy instruments. At the heart of the system was the *Commissariat général du Plan* (General Planning Commission), which was established in 1946. The Plan, as it was known, was responsible for drawing up a series of multi-year indicative plans that set out the government's economic objectives and investment priorities. These plans were developed through a process of consultation and consensus-building, involving representatives from government, industry, and trade unions. While the plans were not legally binding, they had a powerful influence on the allocation of resources. The state used a variety of levers to encourage compliance with the plan, including financial incentives, state procurement, and price controls. The government provided a range of financial incentives to companies that invested in priority sectors, including low-interest loans, tax breaks, and subsidies. The state used its procurement power to support national champions and to promote the development of new technologies. The government had the power to control the prices of key goods and services, which it used to manage inflation and to influence the allocation of resources. The state also played a direct role in the economy through its ownership of a large number of companies in strategic sectors, including energy, transport, and telecommunications. These state-owned enterprises were used to advance the government's economic objectives, and their managers were often drawn from the same elite corps of civil servants who staffed the planning commission and the ministries. [2] [4]

## 6. Evidence & Impact

The impact of French Dirigisme on the country's economic development has been profound and is a subject of ongoing debate. The most significant achievement associated with this framework is the period of rapid economic growth and social transformation known as the *Trente Glorieuses* (1945-1975). During these three decades, the French economy grew at an average annual rate of over 5%, leading to a dramatic increase in living standards and the modernization of French society. The country was transformed from a largely agrarian and fragmented economy into a major industrial power, with world-class infrastructure and a high-skilled workforce. However, the success of Dirigisme was not without its limitations and costs. The oil crisis of 1973 and the subsequent economic slowdown exposed the rigidities and inefficiencies of the model. State-owned enterprises, which had been the engines of growth in the post-war period, became increasingly uncompetitive and a drain on public finances. The close relationship between the state and big business also led to accusations of cronyism and a lack of transparency. By the 1980s, there was a growing consensus that the Dirigiste model had run its course. A series of governments, from both the left and the right, embarked on a program of liberalization, privatization, and deregulation, dismantling many of the key institutions of Dirigisme. While the state continues to play an important role in the French economy, it is no longer the all-powerful director of the post-war era. [1] [3]

## 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

In the cognitive era, characterized by the rise of the knowledge economy and the increasing importance of intangible assets, the traditional tools of Dirigisme may seem outdated. The focus on large-scale industrial projects and the promotion of national champions may be less relevant in a world where innovation is driven by nimble startups and global networks of collaboration. However, the core principles of Dirigisme – the idea that the state has a strategic role to play in shaping the future of the economy – may be more relevant than ever. The challenges of the 21st century, from climate change to the digital transformation, require a long-term vision and a coordinated effort from both the public and private sectors. The concept of a "neo-dirigisme" has emerged, which seeks to adapt the principles of Dirigisme to the new realities of the cognitive era. This new approach would involve the state playing a more enabling role, fostering innovation, investing in education and research, and creating a regulatory environment that is conducive to the growth of the knowledge economy. Rather than picking winners, the state would focus on creating the conditions for a vibrant and dynamic ecosystem of innovation. [3]

## 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

French Dirigisme, with its emphasis on centralized control and state-led development, presents a complex and often contradictory picture when assessed against the principles of a commons-based approach. While it has been successful in achieving certain collective goals, its alignment with the core values of the commons is limited.

| Dimension | Alignment Score (1-5) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Openness & Transparency** | 1 | Decision-making is concentrated within a small, technocratic elite, with limited public participation or scrutiny. The processes of indicative planning and the selection of national champions are largely opaque. |
| **Decentralization & Polycentricity** | 1 | Dirigisme is, by its very nature, a highly centralized framework. Power is concentrated in the hands of the state, with little room for autonomous, polycentric governance structures. |
| **Community & Collaboration** | 3 | The model fosters a strong sense of national community and purpose, and it is built on a close collaboration between the state and large industrial groups. However, this collaboration does not typically extend to the broader civil society or smaller economic actors. |
| **Sustainability & Resilience** | 2 | The primary focus of Dirigisme is on economic growth and industrial development, often with little regard for environmental sustainability or social resilience. The pursuit of large-scale, capital-intensive projects can have significant negative externalities. |
| **Fairness & Equity** | 3 | During the *Trente Glorieuses*, the benefits of economic growth were relatively widely distributed, leading to a significant increase in living standards for the majority of the population. However, the system also created a new elite and could exacerbate inequalities between favored and unfavored sectors. |
| **Subsidiarity & Localism** | 1 | Decisions are made at the highest level of the state, with little scope for local or regional autonomy. The principle of subsidiarity is largely absent from the Dirigiste model. |
| **Pluralism & Diversity** | 2 | The framework tends to promote a monolithic vision of economic development, favoring large, established players and a uniform set of industrial policies. It can stifle experimentation and the emergence of alternative economic models. |

### Deeper Dive into Core Principles

The principle of the **state as a strategic actor** is not merely about intervention, but about a long-term, forward-looking vision for the nation's economic trajectory. This is a proactive stance, where the state doesn't just react to market forces but actively shapes them. This strategic role is underpinned by a deep-seated belief in the capacity of the state to identify and pursue the national interest, a concept that is deeply ingrained in French political and administrative culture. The state's strategic vision is not static; it evolves in response to changing domestic and international conditions. However, the underlying commitment to a state-led industrial policy remains a constant feature of the Dirigiste model. This strategic orientation is what distinguishes Dirigisme from more ad-hoc forms of state intervention. It is a systematic and coherent approach to economic management, with a clear set of long-term objectives.

The notion of **pragmatic interventionism** is another key feature of Dirigisme. The French state has a long tradition of intervening in the economy, but what sets Dirigisme apart is the pragmatic and non-ideological nature of this intervention. The state is not bound by a rigid set of rules or doctrines; it is free to use a wide range of policy instruments to achieve its objectives. This flexibility allows the state to adapt its policies to the specific needs of different industries and to respond to unforeseen challenges. This pragmatism is also reflected in the willingness of the state to work with the private sector. Dirigisme is not about replacing the market, but about guiding it. The state seeks to create a symbiotic relationship with private enterprise, where the pursuit of private profit is aligned with the national interest.

### In-depth Look at Key Practices

**Indicative planning**, as practiced in France, was a sophisticated exercise in economic forecasting and coordination. The *Commissariat général du Plan* brought together experts from government, industry, and trade unions to develop a shared understanding of the economic outlook and to agree on a set of common goals. This process of dialogue and consensus-building was as important as the plan itself. It helped to create a sense of shared purpose and to build trust between the different economic actors. The plans were not just a set of targets; they were a detailed analysis of the challenges and opportunities facing the French economy. They provided a roadmap for the future, guiding the investment decisions of both public and private actors. The success of indicative planning depended on the quality of the information and analysis that went into it, as well as the willingness of the different actors to cooperate in its implementation.

**Technocratic governance** is another essential pillar of the Dirigiste framework. The French state has a long tradition of relying on a highly skilled and professional civil service to manage the economy. The *grandes écoles*, such as the École Nationale d'Administration (ENA) and the École Polytechnique, have produced a steady stream of elite administrators who have played a key role in the formulation and implementation of economic policy. These technocrats, who often move seamlessly between the public and private sectors, share a common culture and a common set of values. They are committed to the idea of a strong and interventionist state, and they see themselves as the guardians of the national interest. This technocratic elite has been a source of both strength and weakness for the Dirigiste model. On the one hand, it has provided the state with the expertise and the capacity to implement complex economic policies. On the other hand, it has been criticized for being elitist, out of touch with the concerns of ordinary citizens, and resistant to change.


### The Post-War Imperative for Dirigisme

The devastation of World War II was the crucible in which French Dirigisme was forged. The physical destruction was immense, but the psychological impact was just as profound. The war had exposed the fragility of the French state and the weakness of its pre-war economic model. There was a widespread sense that a radical break with the past was needed to restore France's greatness and to ensure its future security. This created a political climate that was highly receptive to new ideas and bold experiments in economic policy. The old laissez-faire orthodoxies were discredited, and there was a broad consensus, across the political spectrum, in favor of a more active and interventionist role for the state. The nationalizations that took place in the immediate post-war period were not just a socialist measure; they were supported by a broad coalition of political forces, including the Christian Democrats and the Gaullists. This cross-party support was a crucial factor in the successful implementation of the Dirigiste model.

### The Mechanics of Implementation

The implementation of Dirigisme was a highly institutionalized process. The *Commissariat général du Plan* was the nerve center of the system, but it was supported by a dense network of other institutions, including the Ministry of Finance, the Bank of France, and the various industrial ministries. These institutions worked together to translate the broad objectives of the plan into concrete policies and programs. The state had a wide range of tools at its disposal to influence the behavior of private firms. In addition to the financial incentives and procurement policies mentioned earlier, the state also had the power to grant or withhold licenses, to approve or reject mergers, and to appoint the heads of state-owned enterprises. This gave the state a formidable degree of leverage over the private sector. The relationship between the state and private firms was not always harmonious. There were often tensions and conflicts of interest. However, on the whole, the system was characterized by a high degree of cooperation and a shared commitment to the goals of the plan. This was due in part to the close personal and professional ties that existed between the senior civil servants and the heads of the major industrial groups. Many of them had attended the same *grandes écoles* and shared a common outlook on the world.
