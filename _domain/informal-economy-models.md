### 1. Overview

The informal economy, also known as the grey economy or shadow economy, represents a significant and complex segment of the global economic landscape [1]. It encompasses all economic activities, enterprises, jobs, and workers that are not regulated or protected by the state. This includes a diverse range of activities, from street vending and domestic work to unregistered small-scale manufacturing and services. The informal economy is a critical source of livelihood for a substantial portion of the world's population, particularly in developing countries, where it can account for over half of the workforce and a significant share of the GDP [2]. The informal economy matters because it provides a safety net for those who cannot find employment in the formal sector, and it can be a breeding ground for entrepreneurship and innovation. However, it also presents challenges, including a lack of social protection for workers, unfair competition for formal businesses, and a reduced tax base for governments [3]. The term 'informal sector' was first coined by British anthropologist Keith Hart in a 1971 study on Ghana and was later popularized by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in the 1970s. The concept emerged from the observation that traditional economic models of development were failing to account for the persistence and growth of a vast and vibrant sector of economic activity operating outside the formal legal and regulatory framework [1].

### 2. Core Principles

The informal economy is guided by a set of core principles that distinguish it from the formal sector. A defining characteristic of the informal economy is the high degree of **autonomy and independence** it affords its participants. Unlike the formal sector, which is often characterized by rigid hierarchies and predefined roles, the informal economy allows individuals to be their own bosses, set their own hours, and make their own business decisions. This freedom is a major draw for many, offering a sense of control and self-determination that is often lacking in formal employment. This principle is particularly evident in the prevalence of self-employment within the informal sector, where individuals leverage their skills and resources to create their own livelihood opportunities. Another key principle is the **low barriers to entry** that characterize many informal activities. The informal economy is accessible to a wide range of individuals, regardless of their level of education, skills, or capital. Starting a small-scale vending business, for example, requires minimal investment and no formal qualifications. This accessibility makes the informal economy a crucial safety net for those who are excluded from the formal labor market, such as low-skilled workers, migrants, and women. The informal economy is also highly dynamic and adaptable, able to respond quickly to changing economic conditions and consumer needs. This **flexibility and adaptability** is a key factor in its resilience, enabling it to thrive even in the face of economic shocks and crises. Participants in the informal economy often operate with limited resources and in challenging environments, which has fostered a culture of **resourcefulness and resilience**. This can be seen in the creative use of recycled materials, the development of innovative and low-cost technologies, and the ability to operate and even thrive in the face of adversity. Finally, **reliance on social networks** is a crucial element of the informal economy. These networks provide a range of essential services, including access to information, credit, and social support. In the absence of formal institutions, social networks act as a form of social capital, enabling individuals to overcome challenges and seize opportunities.

### 3. Key Practices

The informal economy manifests in a variety of practices, with **street vending** being one of the most visible and widespread. Street vendors sell a wide variety of goods, from fresh produce and cooked food to clothing and electronics. They often operate from temporary stalls or carts, and their location may vary depending on the time of day and customer traffic. Street vending provides a livelihood for millions of people, particularly women, and it plays a vital role in the distribution of goods and services in many urban areas. **Home-based work** is another significant component of the informal economy. Home-based workers are engaged in a wide range of activities, including garment manufacturing, food processing, and data entry. They are often subcontracted by larger firms, and they may be paid on a piece-rate basis. Home-based work offers flexibility, allowing individuals to combine their work with domestic responsibilities. However, it can also be characterized by low pay, poor working conditions, and a lack of social protection. **Waste picking and recycling** is a practice that provides a livelihood for some of the most marginalized members of society, while also contributing to environmental sustainability. Waste pickers collect, sort, and sell recyclable materials, such as plastic, paper, and metal. In many developing countries, **informal transportation services**, such as motorcycle taxis and minibuses, are the primary means of mobility for a large portion of the population. These services are often more flexible and affordable than formal public transportation. The informal economy is also home to a vibrant sector of **small-scale manufacturing and repair services**, producing a wide range of goods and providing essential repair services. Finally, in the absence of access to formal financial institutions, participants in the informal economy have developed their own systems of credit and savings, such as **informal financial services** like rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs).

### 4. Application Context

The informal economy is best suited for providing a livelihood for individuals excluded from the formal labor market, incubating entrepreneurship in resource-constrained environments, and delivering goods and services to low-income communities. It is not suitable for activities that require a high degree of regulation and oversight, such as the production of pharmaceuticals, or for large-scale infrastructure projects. The informal economy operates at multiple scales, from the **individual** street vendor to **multi-organization** networks of home-based workers. It is most prevalent at the **individual** and **team** level, but it can also be found in larger **organizational** and even **ecosystem** contexts. The informal economy is present in a wide range of domains, including retail and wholesale trade, manufacturing, services, construction, and agriculture.

### 5. Implementation

Implementing a venture in the informal economy typically involves a series of steps. The first is to **identify a market need** for a product or service that is not being adequately supplied by the formal sector. Next, one must **acquire the necessary skills and resources**, which may involve an apprenticeship, a training course, or simply learning by doing. It is often a good idea to **start small and test the market** before making a significant investment. Once the business is up and running, the next step is to **build a customer base** through word-of-mouth, advertising, or by building a reputation for quality and reliability. As the business grows, it is important to **reinvest and grow** by purchasing new equipment, expanding the product line, or hiring additional workers. However, there are several common challenges to implementation, including a **lack of access to capital**, **harassment and extortion**, a **lack of social protection**, **competition from the formal sector**, and a **lack of skills and training**. Success factors include an **entrepreneurial spirit**, **strong social networks**, a **supportive policy environment**, **access to markets**, and **innovation and adaptability**.

### 6. Evidence & Impact

The impact of the informal economy is well-documented. **Grameen Bank** in Bangladesh, while a formal institution, was designed to serve the needs of the informal economy by providing microfinance to impoverished individuals. **WIEGO (Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing)** is a global network dedicated to empowering women in the informal economy. In India, the **SEWA (Self-Employed Women's Association)** is a trade union that organizes self-employed women in the informal economy. The **"Cartoneros" of Buenos Aires** are a well-known example of organized waste pickers. The informal economy has been shown to be a powerful engine of **poverty reduction**, providing a livelihood for billions of people. It can lead to **increased income**, particularly for women and other marginalized groups, and provide a pathway to **improved livelihoods**. The informal economy also contributes significantly to **economic growth**, particularly in developing countries. Research from **The World Bank**, the **International Labour Organization (ILO)**, and **WIEGO** has consistently highlighted the importance of the informal economy for poverty reduction and economic development [2, 4, 5].

### 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

The cognitive era, characterized by the rise of artificial intelligence and automation, has the potential to both disrupt and empower the informal economy. **Cognitive augmentation potential** is significant, as AI-powered tools can provide informal workers with access to information, markets, and financial services that were previously out of reach. However, there is also a risk of job displacement, making the **human-machine balance** a critical consideration. It is crucial to strike a balance between human and machine labor, ensuring that technology is used to augment, rather than replace, human capabilities. The **evolution outlook** for the informal economy in the cognitive era is one of transformation. We may see the emergence of new forms of informal work, such as in the gig economy and the platform economy, and a blurring of the lines between the formal and informal economies.

### 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

The informal economy's alignment with commons principles is a complex and evolving issue. In terms of **stakeholder mapping**, the informal economy involves a wide range of actors, but the voices of informal workers are often marginalized. A commons-aligned approach would seek to create a more inclusive and participatory governance structure. The informal economy creates significant **value creation**, but this value is often not recognized or captured by the formal system. A commons-aligned approach would seek a more equitable distribution of value. The informal economy is resilient, but also vulnerable to shocks, and a commons-aligned approach would focus on **value preservation** by providing access to social protection and finance. The informal economy is characterized by a lack of **shared rights & responsibilities**, and a commons-aligned approach would seek to establish a framework of rights and responsibilities for all participants. The informal economy often lacks **systematic design**, and a commons-aligned approach would promote a more systematic and coordinated approach to its development. The informal economy is part of a larger **systems of systems**, and a commons-aligned approach would seek a more integrated and holistic approach to its development. The principles of the informal economy have **fractal properties**, and a commons-aligned approach would promote their application at all scales.

**Overall Score**: 3 (Transitional)

The informal economy is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that has both positive and negative aspects. A commons-aligned approach to the informal economy would seek to address its challenges by creating a more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable economic system. This would involve a range of interventions, including legal and policy reforms, the promotion of collective action, and the provision of access to finance, training, and social protection.
