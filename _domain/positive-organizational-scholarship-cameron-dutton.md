## 1. Overview

Positive Organizational Scholarship (POS) is a field of study that focuses on the positive aspects of organizations and their members. It seeks to understand and explain what is positive, flourishing, and life-giving in organizations, and how to cultivate these qualities. POS is not a single theory, but rather a broad perspective that encompasses a variety of concepts and research streams. It is concerned with topics such as excellence, thriving, resilience, virtuousness, and meaningfulness.

The core problem that POS addresses is the traditional focus of organizational studies on negative phenomena, such as dysfunction, conflict, and stress. POS argues that this focus has led to an incomplete and unbalanced understanding of organizational life. By focusing on the positive, POS aims to provide a more complete and accurate picture of organizations, and to identify ways to create more positive and effective workplaces.

The origin of POS can be traced to a group of scholars at the University of Michigan, including Kim S. Cameron, Jane E. Dutton, and Robert E. Quinn. In the early 2000s, they began to articulate the need for a new approach to organizational studies that would focus on the positive. They argued that the existing focus on the negative was not only incomplete, but also had a number of negative consequences, such as creating a sense of helplessness and cynicism. The publication of their book, "Positive Organizational Scholarship: Foundations of a New Discipline," in 2003 is considered a landmark event in the development of the field.

## 2. Core Principles

Positive Organizational Scholarship is guided by a set of core principles that distinguish it from traditional approaches to organizational studies. These principles provide a framework for understanding and promoting positive phenomena in organizations.

1.  **Positive Deviance**: POS is interested in what goes right in organizations, in the exceptional, not the average. It's about understanding the unexpectedly positive. This means studying organizations and individuals that demonstrate extraordinary success, and identifying the factors that contribute to their success. By focusing on positive deviance, POS aims to uncover new and innovative ways to improve organizational performance and well-being.

2.  **Affirmative Bias**: POS has an affirmative bias, which means that it focuses on strengths, capabilities, and possibilities, rather than on weaknesses, problems, and limitations. This is not to say that POS ignores the negative aspects of organizational life, but rather that it seeks to understand how to build on the positive to create more effective and resilient organizations.

3.  **Scholarly Rigor**: POS is committed to scholarly rigor and the use of scientific methods to study positive phenomena. This means that POS research is based on empirical evidence, and that its claims are subject to peer review and critique. By maintaining a high level of scholarly rigor, POS aims to build a credible and cumulative body of knowledge about what makes organizations and their members flourish.

4.  **Broaden and Build**: POS draws on the "broaden-and-build" theory of positive emotions, which suggests that positive emotions broaden people's thought-action repertoires and build their personal resources. This means that positive emotions are not just pleasant feelings, but they also have a number of important cognitive and social benefits. By cultivating positive emotions in the workplace, organizations can enhance creativity, problem-solving, and social relationships.

5.  **Focus on Strengths**: POS emphasizes the importance of focusing on strengths, both at the individual and organizational level. This is based on the idea that people and organizations are more successful when they build on their strengths, rather than trying to fix their weaknesses. By identifying and developing their strengths, individuals and organizations can achieve higher levels of performance and fulfillment.

## 3. Key Practices

Positive Organizational Scholarship is not just a theoretical perspective; it also offers a number of practical tools and techniques for creating more positive and effective organizations. These practices are designed to help individuals and organizations cultivate positive emotions, build on their strengths, and create a more meaningful and fulfilling work environment.

1.  **Appreciative Inquiry (AI)**: AI is a process of organizational change that focuses on identifying and amplifying what is working well in an organization, rather than on fixing what is broken. It involves a four-stage process of Discovery, Dream, Design, and Destiny. By focusing on the positive, AI helps to create a more optimistic and energized workforce, and to unleash the creative potential of the organization.

2.  **Strengths-Based Development**: This practice involves identifying and developing the strengths of individuals and teams, rather than focusing on their weaknesses. It is based on the idea that people are more engaged and effective when they are able to use their strengths at work. A variety of tools and assessments are available to help individuals and organizations identify their strengths, such as the CliftonStrengths (formerly StrengthsFinder) assessment.

3.  **Cultivating Positive Emotions**: This practice involves creating a work environment that is conducive to the experience of positive emotions, such as joy, gratitude, and interest. This can be done through a variety of means, such as celebrating successes, expressing appreciation, and providing opportunities for employees to engage in meaningful and challenging work. Research has shown that positive emotions can have a number of benefits, including enhanced creativity, problem-solving, and resilience.

4.  **Fostering High-Quality Connections**: High-quality connections are relationships between individuals that are characterized by mutual respect, trust, and positive regard. These connections are essential for creating a positive and supportive work environment. Organizations can foster high-quality connections by providing opportunities for employees to interact and collaborate, and by promoting a culture of respect and appreciation.

5.  **Promoting Virtuousness**: This involves fostering a culture of virtuousness in the organization, which includes qualities such as compassion, forgiveness, and integrity. Research has shown that virtuousness can have a number of positive outcomes, including improved financial performance and employee well-being. Organizations can promote virtuousness by establishing clear ethical guidelines, and by recognizing and rewarding virtuous behavior.

6.  **Authentic Leadership**: Authentic leaders are individuals who are self-aware, transparent, and true to their values. They are able to inspire trust and commitment in their followers, and to create a positive and ethical work environment. Organizations can develop authentic leaders by providing them with opportunities for self-reflection and personal growth.

7.  **Resilience Training**: Resilience is the ability to bounce back from adversity. It is an essential quality for individuals and organizations in today's fast-paced and unpredictable world. Organizations can help their employees develop resilience by providing them with training in stress management, mindfulness, and other coping skills.

## 4. Application Context

Positive Organizational Scholarship can be applied in a wide range of contexts, from small teams to large corporations. It is particularly well-suited for organizations that are looking to create a more positive and engaging work environment, and to improve their overall performance and well-being.

- **Best Used For**:
    - **Organizational Change and Development**: POS provides a powerful framework for guiding organizational change in a positive direction. It can be used to create a more optimistic and energized workforce, and to unleash the creative potential of the organization.
    - **Leadership Development**: POS offers a new and inspiring vision of leadership that is based on the principles of authenticity, virtuousness, and strengths. It can be used to develop leaders who are able to create a positive and ethical work environment.
    - **Improving Employee Engagement and Well-being**: POS provides a variety of tools and techniques for improving employee engagement and well-being. By cultivating positive emotions, building on strengths, and fostering high-quality connections, organizations can create a more supportive and fulfilling work environment.
    - **Enhancing Innovation and Creativity**: POS can help to create a work environment that is conducive to innovation and creativity. By encouraging positive emotions and psychological safety, organizations can unleash the creative potential of their employees.

- **Not Suitable For**:
    - **Crisis Management**: In situations that require immediate and decisive action, a more directive and top-down approach may be necessary. POS is better suited for long-term organizational development, rather than for short-term crisis management.
    - **Deep-Seated Cynicism**: In organizations with a deep-seated culture of cynicism and distrust, the principles of POS may be met with resistance. In such cases, it may be necessary to address the underlying issues of trust and communication before attempting to implement POS.

- **Scale**: The principles of POS are fractal and can be applied at all scales, from the **individual** to the **ecosystem** level. This means that POS can be used to improve the well-being and performance of individuals, teams, departments, organizations, and even entire industries.

- **Domains**: POS has been applied in a wide variety of domains, including **business**, **healthcare**, **education**, **government**, and the **non-profit sector**. Its principles are universal and can be adapted to any organizational context.

## 5. Implementation

Implementing Positive Organizational Scholarship requires a conscious and sustained effort from all members of the organization. It is not a quick fix, but rather a long-term journey of cultural transformation. The following provides a roadmap for getting started with POS, as well as some common challenges and success factors to keep in mind.

- **Prerequisites**:
    - **Leadership Buy-in**: The most important prerequisite for implementing POS is strong and visible support from senior leadership. Leaders need to be willing to champion the principles of POS, and to model the desired behaviors.
    - **A Culture of Trust**: POS thrives in a culture of trust, where employees feel safe to express themselves and to take risks. If the existing culture is characterized by fear and distrust, it will be difficult to implement POS.
    - **A Willingness to Learn and Experiment**: POS is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It requires a willingness to learn and experiment with different practices and approaches, and to adapt them to the specific needs of the organization.

- **Getting Started**:
    - **Start Small**: It is often best to start with a small pilot project, rather than trying to implement POS across the entire organization at once. This allows the organization to learn and experiment in a low-risk environment.
    - **Focus on a Specific Area**: It is also helpful to focus on a specific area of the organization, such as a particular department or team. This allows the organization to tailor its efforts to the specific needs of that area.
    - **Provide Training and Education**: It is important to provide employees with training and education on the principles and practices of POS. This will help them to understand the rationale behind the new approach, and to develop the skills they need to succeed.
    - **Measure and Celebrate Success**: It is important to measure the impact of POS on key outcomes, such as employee engagement, well-being, and performance. It is also important to celebrate successes along the way, in order to build momentum and sustain motivation.

- **Common Challenges**:
    - **Resistance to Change**: As with any organizational change initiative, there is likely to be some resistance to POS. This resistance may come from employees who are skeptical of the new approach, or who are comfortable with the status quo.
    - **Lack of Time and Resources**: Implementing POS can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. It is important to be realistic about the time and resources that are available, and to plan accordingly.
    - **Difficulty in Measuring ROI**: It can be difficult to measure the return on investment (ROI) of POS, as many of its benefits are intangible. This can make it difficult to justify the investment in POS to senior leadership.

- **Success Factors**:
    - **Sustained Leadership Commitment**: The most important success factor is sustained commitment from senior leadership. Leaders need to be willing to champion POS over the long term, and to provide the resources and support that are needed to succeed.
    - **Employee Involvement**: It is important to involve employees in the design and implementation of POS. This will help to ensure that the new approach is relevant to their needs, and that they are committed to its success.
    - **A Focus on Continuous Improvement**: POS is not a one-time event, but rather a continuous process of learning and improvement. It is important to regularly review and refine the approach, in order to ensure that it remains effective over time.

## 6. Evidence & Impact

Positive Organizational Scholarship has a growing body of evidence to support its effectiveness. A wide range of organizations have adopted its principles and practices, and have reported significant improvements in employee engagement, well-being, and performance. The following are some notable adopters and documented outcomes of POS.

- **Notable Adopters**:
    - **LinkedIn**: The professional networking company has used a values-based approach to candidate selection, which is a key practice of POS. This has helped them to build a strong and positive organizational culture.
    - **Women Employed**: This non-profit political advocacy organization has used an energy-based approach to leadership, which is another key practice of POS. This has helped them to motivate their employees and to overcome significant challenges.
    - **B&O Railroad Museum**: The museum used the principles of POS to recover from a devastating snowstorm that destroyed its roof and most of its collection. By focusing on resilience and opportunity, the museum was able to get back on track and to emerge stronger than before.
    - **Bronson Healthcare**: This healthcare system has a unique culture that recognizes and rewards its employees. It champions diversity and continuous improvement, and has been recognized as a great place to work.
    - **Cascade Engineering**: This manufacturing company has adopted a triple-bottom-line approach to business, which prioritizes people, planet, and profit. It has been recognized for its commitment to social and environmental responsibility.

- **Documented Outcomes**:

    - **Enhanced Employee Well-being**: POS practices have been shown to improve employee well-being, by reducing stress and burnout, and by increasing job satisfaction and engagement.
    - **Increased Innovation and Creativity**: By creating a positive and supportive work environment, POS can help to unleash the creative potential of employees.

- **Research Support**:
    - **The Oxford Handbook of Positive Organizational Scholarship**: This handbook provides a comprehensive overview of the research on POS, and includes contributions from leading scholars in the field.
    - **The Center for Positive Organizations at the University of Michigan**: This center is a leading hub for research and education on POS. It has produced a wealth of research on the topic, including a number of case studies and white papers.

## 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

As we move into the cognitive era, the principles of Positive Organizational Scholarship are more relevant than ever. The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation in the workplace is creating new challenges and opportunities for organizations. POS can help organizations to navigate this transition in a way that is both effective and humane.

- **Cognitive Augmentation Potential**: AI and automation have the potential to augment human capabilities in a number of ways. For example, AI can be used to automate repetitive and mundane tasks, freeing up employees to focus on more creative and strategic work. AI can also be used to provide employees with real-time feedback and coaching, helping them to develop their skills and to improve their performance.

- **Human-Machine Balance**: As AI and automation become more prevalent in the workplace, it is important to strike a balance between the capabilities of machines and the unique strengths of humans. While machines may be better at certain tasks, such as data analysis and pattern recognition, humans are still superior at tasks that require creativity, empathy, and social intelligence. POS can help organizations to create a work environment that leverages the strengths of both humans and machines.

- **Evolution Outlook**: In the cognitive era, the principles of POS are likely to become even more important. As routine tasks are automated, the demand for uniquely human skills, such as creativity, collaboration, and emotional intelligence, will increase. Organizations that are able to cultivate these skills in their employees will be better positioned to succeed in the future. POS provides a roadmap for creating a work environment that is conducive to the development of these skills.

## 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

This section assesses the alignment of Positive Organizational Scholarship with the principles of a commons. The assessment is based on the seven dimensions of the Commons OS, and provides an overall score and a rationale for the score.

1.  **Stakeholder Mapping**: POS has a strong focus on the well-being of employees, and it recognizes the importance of creating a positive and supportive work environment. However, it does not explicitly address the role of other stakeholders, such as customers, suppliers, and the community. The focus is primarily on the internal dynamics of the organization. To improve its alignment with this dimension, POS could be expanded to include a more explicit consideration of the needs and interests of all stakeholders.

2.  **Value Creation**: POS is focused on creating value for both individuals and organizations. It aims to create a work environment that is both productive and fulfilling. However, the focus is primarily on the creation of economic and psychological value. It does not explicitly address the creation of social and environmental value. To improve its alignment with this dimension, POS could be expanded to include a more explicit consideration of the social and environmental impact of organizations.

3.  **Value Preservation**: POS is focused on creating sustainable organizations that are able to thrive over the long term. It does this by building on the strengths of individuals and organizations, and by fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement. However, it does not explicitly address the issue of intergenerational equity. To improve its alignment with this dimension, POS could be expanded to include a more explicit consideration of the long-term impact of organizations on future generations.

4.  **Shared Rights & Responsibilities**: POS is focused on empowering employees and giving them a voice in the organization. It does this by promoting a culture of trust and collaboration. However, it does not explicitly address the issue of ownership and governance. To improve its alignment with this dimension, POS could be expanded to include a more explicit consideration of alternative models of ownership and governance, such as cooperatives and steward-ownership.

5.  **Systematic Design**: POS is focused on creating systems and processes that support the flourishing of individuals and organizations. It does this by promoting a culture of continuous learning and improvement. However, it does not explicitly address the issue of systemic change. To improve its alignment with this dimension, POS could be expanded to include a more explicit consideration of the role of organizations in creating a more just and sustainable world.

6.  **Systems of Systems**: POS is focused on the internal dynamics of organizations. It does not explicitly address the role of organizations in the broader ecosystem. To improve its alignment with this dimension, POS could be expanded to include a more explicit consideration of the interconnectedness of organizations and the need for collaboration and collective action.

7.  **Fractal Properties**: The principles of POS are fractal and can be applied at all scales, from the individual to the organization. This is a key strength of the pattern, and it is well-aligned with the principles of a commons.

**Overall Score**: 3 (Transitional)

**Rationale**: POS is a valuable and important field of study that has the potential to create more humane and effective organizations. However, it is still in a transitional stage in its development. It has a strong focus on the well-being of employees, but it does not yet have a fully developed understanding of the role of organizations in the broader social and ecological context. To become more fully aligned with the principles of a commons, POS needs to expand its focus to include a more explicit consideration of the needs and interests of all stakeholders, the social and environmental impact of organizations, and the role of organizations in creating a more just and sustainable world.
