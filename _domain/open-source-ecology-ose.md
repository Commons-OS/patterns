# 1. Overview

Open Source Ecology (OSE) is a movement and organization dedicated to creating an open-source economy. Founded by Marcin Jakubowski in 2003, OSE's primary mission is to develop and popularize the Global Village Construction Set (GVCS), a set of 50 industrial machines that can be built and maintained at a fraction of the cost of their commercial counterparts. The GVCS is designed to provide the tools necessary to build a small, self-sufficient civilization with modern comforts. OSE aims to create a world of material abundance for all, where the necessities of life are not scarce, and innovation is driven by open collaboration rather than competition. The project is based on the idea that by making the tools of production accessible to everyone, we can create a more just and sustainable world. OSE's work is a direct challenge to the current economic system, which is based on scarcity and competition. By open-sourcing the means of production, OSE is creating a new economic paradigm, one that is based on collaboration, abundance, and sustainability. The organization's work is not just about building machines; it is about building a new kind of society, one that is more resilient, more equitable, and more in harmony with the natural world.

# 2. Core Principles

Open Source Ecology operates on a set of core principles that guide its work and development. These principles are designed to foster a culture of collaboration, transparency, and sustainability. The key principles include:

At the heart of Open Source Ecology are five core principles that guide its work and development. First and foremost is the principle of **Open Source**, which dictates that all of OSE's designs, plans, and documentation are made freely available to the public under a Creative Commons license. This fosters a collaborative environment for innovation by allowing anyone to use, modify, and distribute the information. The second principle is **Modularity**, which is embodied in the design of the Global Village Construction Set (GVCS). Each machine in the GVCS is a self-contained unit that can be combined with others to create more complex systems, allowing for flexibility and scalability. The third principle is **DIY (Do-It-Yourself)**, which emphasizes hands-on learning and self-reliance. By empowering individuals and communities to build their own machines, OSE promotes self-sufficiency and local control over production. The fourth principle is **Sustainability**, which is reflected in OSE's commitment to developing technologies that are not only affordable and accessible but also environmentally friendly. This includes the use of renewable energy sources, designing for durability and repairability, and minimizing waste. Finally, the principle of **Distributive Economics** guides OSE's efforts to create a more equitable and just economic system. By decentralizing production and empowering local communities, OSE seeks to reduce dependence on global supply chains and create more resilient local economies.

# 3. Key Practices

Open Source Ecology employs several key practices to achieve its goals. These practices are designed to be replicable and scalable, allowing others to adopt and adapt them to their own contexts.

**Global Village Construction Set (GVCS):** The GVCS is the cornerstone of OSE's work. It is a set of 50 industrial machines that are designed to be built and maintained by a small team of people. The GVCS is a comprehensive toolkit for building a sustainable civilization, and it includes a wide range of machines, from agricultural equipment like the LifeTrac tractor and the microcombine harvester, to construction tools like the compressed earth block press and the sawmill, to energy and manufacturing equipment like the Power Cube and the induction furnace. The machines are designed to be modular and interoperable, so they can be combined to create more complex systems. For example, the Power Cube, a modular power unit, can be used to power a variety of GVCS machines. The GVCS is intended to provide all the tools necessary to build and maintain a small, modern civilization, from growing food and building houses to manufacturing electronics and machinery.

**Extreme Manufacturing (XM):** XM is a rapid, intensive, and collaborative manufacturing process that OSE has developed. It is a form of social production that leverages the power of a large group of people to achieve a common goal. XM events are typically one-day or multi-day workshops where participants work together to build a machine or structure from scratch. For example, OSE has used XM to build a LifeTrac tractor in a single day and a complete house in just five days. XM is not just about building things quickly; it is also about building community and transferring knowledge. By working together on a challenging project, participants learn new skills, build relationships, and develop a sense of collective efficacy. XM is a powerful tool for bootstrapping a local economy, as it allows a community to quickly and easily acquire the tools and infrastructure it needs to become more self-sufficient.

**Open Source Microfactory:** The Open Source Microfactory is a small-scale, local manufacturing facility that can produce a wide range of goods. The concept is based on the idea of using the GVCS to create a self-sufficient local economy. The microfactory would be a community-owned and operated facility that would provide a space for people to come together to design, build, and sell their own products. The microfactory would be equipped with a variety of GVCS machines, as well as other tools and equipment. The goal is to create a network of microfactories that can share designs and knowledge, creating a decentralized and resilient manufacturing system. The Open Source Microfactory is a key component of OSE's vision for a new economic paradigm, one that is based on collaboration, abundance, and sustainability.

# 4. Application Context

Open Source Ecology's patterns and practices can be applied in a wide range of contexts, from individual homesteads to entire communities. The primary application is in the creation of self-sufficient and resilient communities that are not dependent on global supply chains. The GVCS can be used to produce food, shelter, energy, and other necessities of life, while the principles of open source and collaboration can be used to foster a sense of community and shared purpose. OSE's work is particularly relevant in the context of disaster relief and post-conflict reconstruction, where the ability to quickly and easily build infrastructure is essential. It also has applications in education, where the hands-on, project-based learning approach can be used to teach a wide range of skills, from engineering and design to agriculture and construction.

# 5. Implementation

Implementing the Open Source Ecology pattern involves a multi-faceted approach that combines technology, community, and a commitment to open-source principles. The implementation process can be broken down into several key stages:

**1. Education and Training:** The first step in implementing OSE is to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills. OSE offers a variety of educational programs, including workshops, online courses, and immersion experiences at Factor e Farm. These programs are designed to teach people how to build and use the GVCS machines, as well as the principles of open-source hardware and sustainable agriculture.

**2. Building the Global Village Construction Set (GVCS):** Once a team has the necessary skills, they can begin to build the GVCS. OSE provides detailed blueprints, instructional videos, and community support to help with the construction process. The machines are designed to be built with readily available materials and tools, and the modular design allows for a phased implementation, where machines are built as they are needed.

**3. Establishing an Open Source Microfactory:** With the GVCS in place, a community can establish an Open Source Microfactory. This involves setting up a workshop or makerspace where the machines can be used to produce a variety of goods. The microfactory can be used to produce everything from building materials and furniture to electronics and machinery. The goal is to create a local, self-sufficient economy that is not dependent on global supply chains.

**4. Community Building and Collaboration:** The success of an OSE implementation depends on a strong and vibrant community. This involves creating a culture of collaboration, where people are willing to share their knowledge and skills. OSE encourages the formation of local chapters and online forums to facilitate communication and collaboration. The Extreme Manufacturing process is also a powerful tool for community building, as it brings people together to work on a common project.

# 6. Evidence & Impact

Open Source Ecology has demonstrated significant impact since its inception. The most tangible evidence of its success is the development and prototyping of the Global Village Construction Set. As of 2018, 33% of the 50 machines had been prototyped, with several, including the LifeTrac tractor and the Liberator compressed earth brick press, having reached a mature stage of development. These machines have been built and used at Factor e Farm and by other groups around the world, demonstrating their viability and effectiveness.

The impact of OSE can also be seen in the growing community of people who are involved in the project. The OSE wiki is a vibrant hub of activity, with thousands of people contributing to the development of the GVCS. The project has also received significant media attention, including a TED Talk by founder Marcin Jakubowski that has been viewed over 2 million times. This has helped to raise awareness of the potential of open-source hardware to create a more sustainable and equitable world.

Furthermore, OSE's work has inspired a number of spin-off projects and collaborations. For example, OSE has partnered with the Open Building Institute to develop affordable, open-source housing. The project has also inspired the creation of OSE Germany, an independent organization that is working to adapt and apply OSE's principles in a European context.

# 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

In the Cognitive Era, characterized by the increasing importance of information, knowledge, and collaboration, the principles of Open Source Ecology are more relevant than ever. OSE's emphasis on open-source knowledge sharing and decentralized production aligns perfectly with the distributed and collaborative nature of the cognitive economy. The GVCS can be seen as a physical manifestation of the open-source ethos, enabling anyone with the motivation and skills to become a producer, not just a consumer.

The rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning also presents new opportunities for OSE. For example, AI could be used to optimize the design of the GVCS machines, or to create personalized learning paths for people who want to learn how to build and use them. The combination of open-source hardware and AI could lead to a new wave of innovation, creating a world where technology is used to empower individuals and communities, rather than to concentrate power in the hands of a few.

# 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

Open Source Ecology is deeply aligned with the principles of the commons. The project is dedicated to creating a world of shared resources, where knowledge and technology are freely available to all. The following table provides an assessment of OSE's alignment with the seven dimensions of the commons:

| Dimension | Alignment Score (1-5) | Rationale |
