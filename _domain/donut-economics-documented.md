# Donut Economics

## 1. Overview

Donut Economics is a groundbreaking economic model that redefines the concept of prosperity for the 21st century. Developed by British economist Kate Raworth, it offers a compelling alternative to the traditional, growth-oriented economic paradigm. The model is visualized as a donut, with a social foundation of well-being that no one should fall below, and an ecological ceiling of planetary pressure that we should not overshoot. The space between these two boundaries is the “safe and just space for humanity.”

This framework challenges the long-held assumption that endless GDP growth is the ultimate measure of success. Instead, it proposes a more holistic approach that balances the needs of people with the health of the planet. The Donut is not a rigid prescription, but a flexible and adaptable framework that can be applied at various scales, from local communities to national governments and international organizations.

## 2. Core Principles

The Donut Economics model is built upon two fundamental sets of boundaries: the social foundation and the ecological ceiling.

### The Social Foundation

The social foundation represents the essential requirements for human well-being, ensuring that everyone has access to the necessities of life. These are derived from the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and include twelve dimensions:

*   **Food:** Access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food.
*   **Health:** Universal access to quality healthcare.
*   **Education:** Lifelong learning opportunities for all.
*   **Income & Work:** Decent work and sufficient income for a dignified life.
*   **Peace & Justice:** Safe and just societies with strong institutions.
*   **Political Voice:** Inclusive and democratic decision-making processes.
*   **Social Equity:** Equal opportunities and outcomes for all, regardless of background.
*   **Gender Equality:** Equal rights and opportunities for women and girls.
*   **Housing:** Access to safe, affordable, and adequate housing.
*   **Networks:** Social and digital connectivity.
*   **Energy:** Access to clean and affordable energy.
*   **Water:** Sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.

### The Ecological Ceiling

The ecological ceiling consists of nine planetary boundaries, which are the limits of Earth's life-supporting systems. Overshooting these boundaries could lead to irreversible environmental damage and threaten the stability of the planet. These boundaries are:

*   **Climate Change:** Limiting greenhouse gas emissions to prevent dangerous temperature rise.
*   **Ocean Acidification:** Preventing the ongoing decrease in the pH of the Earth's oceans.
*   **Chemical Pollution:** Reducing the release of harmful chemicals into the environment.
*   **Nitrogen & Phosphorus Loading:** Managing the use of fertilizers to prevent water pollution.
*   **Freshwater Withdrawals:** Ensuring the sustainable use of freshwater resources.
*   **Land Conversion:** Protecting forests and other natural habitats from being converted to other uses.
*   **Biodiversity Loss:** Halting the loss of species and genetic diversity.
*   **Air Pollution:** Reducing the emission of pollutants that harm human health and the environment.
*   **Ozone Layer Depletion:** Protecting the ozone layer from depletion by harmful chemicals.

## 3. Key Practices

Donut Economics is not just a theoretical framework; it is a call to action. It encourages a shift in mindset and the adoption of new practices to create a more just and sustainable world. Here are some of the key practices associated with the model:

### Shifting from GDP Growth to a Holistic View

One of the central tenets of Donut Economics is the need to move beyond the narrow focus on GDP growth as the primary measure of economic success. Instead, it advocates for a more holistic approach that considers a wider range of social and environmental indicators. This means tracking progress on the twelve social foundations and the nine ecological ceilings, and using this information to guide policy and decision-making.

### Applying the Donut at Different Scales

The Donut can be applied at various scales, from local communities to national governments and international organizations. At the local level, cities like Amsterdam have embraced the Donut as a framework for their post-pandemic recovery plans. At the national level, countries can use the Donut to assess their overall performance and identify areas where they need to improve. At the international level, the Donut can provide a common framework for global cooperation on sustainable development.

### The Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist

In her book, "Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist," Kate Raworth outlines seven key shifts in thinking that are needed to create a more just and sustainable world:

1.  **Change the Goal:** From GDP growth to the Doughnut.
2.  **See the Big Picture:** From a self-contained market to a complex, embedded economy.
3.  **Nurture Human Nature:** From rational economic man to social, adaptable humans.
4.  **Get Savvy with Systems:** From mechanical equilibrium to dynamic complexity.
5.  **Design to Distribute:** From “growth will even it up again” to distributive by design.
6.  **Create to Regenerate:** From “growth will clean it up again” to regenerative by design.
7.  **Be Agnostic about Growth:** From growth-addicted to growth-agnostic.

## 4. Application Context

The Donut Economics model is a versatile framework that can be applied in a wide range of contexts. It is particularly relevant for:

*   **Cities and Regions:** The Donut can be used to create a more just and sustainable vision for urban development. Cities like Amsterdam, Brussels, and Nanaimo have already started to apply the Donut to their local contexts.
*   **Businesses:** The Donut can help businesses to rethink their purpose and their role in society. It can inspire them to adopt more sustainable and socially responsible practices.
*   **Governments:** The Donut can provide a new compass for public policy, helping governments to create a more just and sustainable future for their citizens.
*   **Communities:** The Donut can empower communities to take control of their own development and create a more resilient and equitable future for themselves.

## 5. Implementation

Implementing the Donut Economics model requires a collaborative and participatory approach. Here are some of the key steps involved:

1.  **Create a Doughnut Portrait:** The first step is to create a “Doughnut Portrait” of your place, which is a snapshot of its current social and ecological performance. This involves gathering data on the twelve social foundations and the nine ecological ceilings.
2.  **Engage the Community:** The next step is to engage the community in a conversation about the Doughnut Portrait. This is an opportunity to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing your place, and to co-create a vision for a more just and sustainable future.
3.  **Develop a Plan of Action:** Once you have a shared vision, you can start to develop a plan of action. This should include specific goals, targets, and indicators for each of the twelve social foundations and the nine ecological ceilings.
4.  **Monitor and Evaluate Progress:** It is important to monitor and evaluate your progress over time. This will help you to learn from your successes and failures, and to adapt your plan as needed.

The Doughnut Economics Action Lab (DEAL) website provides a wealth of tools and resources to support the implementation of the Donut Economics model. These include a step-by-step guide to creating a Doughnut Portrait, a library of case studies, and a community of practice where you can connect with others who are working to put the Donut into action.

## 6. Evidence & Impact

The Donut Economics model is still relatively new, but it is already having a significant impact on the way that people think about and practice economics. Here are some examples of its impact:

*   **Cities:** The Donut has been embraced by a growing number of cities around the world, including Amsterdam, Brussels, and Nanaimo. These cities are using the Donut to guide their post-pandemic recovery plans and to create a more just and sustainable future for their citizens.
*   **Businesses:** The Donut is inspiring a new generation of businesses that are committed to creating value for all stakeholders, not just shareholders. These businesses are adopting more sustainable and socially responsible practices, and they are working to create a more regenerative and distributive economy.
*   **Education:** The Donut is being taught in universities and schools around the world. It is helping to educate a new generation of economists who are equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to create a more just and sustainable world.

However, the model is not without its critics. Some have argued that it is too idealistic and that it does not provide a clear roadmap for implementation. Others have questioned whether it is possible to achieve a high standard of living for all without economic growth. These are valid concerns, and they highlight the need for further research and experimentation to test the viability of the Donut Economics model in different contexts.

## 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

The Donut Economics model is particularly relevant in the context of the cognitive era, which is characterized by the rise of artificial intelligence, big data, and other advanced technologies. These technologies have the potential to both support and undermine the implementation of the Donut.

On the one hand, technology can be used to gather and analyze the data needed to create a Doughnut Portrait. It can also be used to develop new solutions to the social and ecological challenges we face. For example, AI can be used to optimize energy consumption, reduce waste, and improve the efficiency of our food systems.

On the other hand, technology can also be used to exacerbate existing inequalities and to create new forms of social and environmental harm. For example, the automation of jobs could lead to mass unemployment and social unrest. The use of AI in surveillance and social credit systems could threaten our privacy and our freedom.

Therefore, it is essential to ensure that the development and deployment of new technologies are guided by the principles of the Donut. This means prioritizing the well-being of people and the planet over the pursuit of profit and power. It also means ensuring that the benefits of technology are shared by all, not just a privileged few.

## 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

Donut Economics is highly aligned with the principles of the commons. It recognizes that the economy is embedded in society and nature, and that we have a collective responsibility to protect our shared resources. The model's emphasis on social equity, environmental sustainability, and democratic governance is consistent with the core values of the commons movement.

Here is a brief assessment of Donut Economics against the seven dimensions of commons alignment:

1.  **Shared Resources:** The Donut explicitly recognizes the importance of shared resources, both social and ecological. It calls for the sustainable management of these resources for the benefit of all.
2.  **Community Governance:** The Donut promotes a participatory and democratic approach to governance. It empowers communities to take control of their own development and to create a more just and sustainable future for themselves.
3.  **Social and Ecological Well-being:** The Donut prioritizes the well-being of people and the planet over the pursuit of profit and power. It provides a holistic framework for assessing progress towards a more just and sustainable world.
4.  **Fairness and Equity:** The Donut is deeply committed to the principles of fairness and equity. It calls for a more just distribution of resources and opportunities, and it seeks to empower marginalized and vulnerable groups.
5.  **Openness and Transparency:** The Donut promotes a culture of openness and transparency. It encourages the sharing of data and information, and it calls for greater accountability in decision-making.
6.  **Collaboration and Cooperation:** The Donut is a collaborative and cooperative framework. It brings together a wide range of actors, including governments, businesses, and civil society, to work together towards a common goal.
7.  **Peer Production and Co-creation:** The Donut is a living and evolving framework that is co-created by a global community of practitioners. It is a powerful example of peer production and co-creation in action.

Overall, Donut Economics is a powerful and inspiring framework that has the potential to transform our economy and our society. It is a model that is deeply aligned with the principles of the commons, and it offers a hopeful vision for a more just and sustainable future.
