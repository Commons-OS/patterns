### 1. Overview

The Planetary Boundaries framework is a concept that defines a "safe operating space for humanity" by identifying and quantifying nine critical Earth system processes that regulate the stability and resilience of the planet. The framework was introduced in 2009 by a group of 28 international scientists led by Johan Rockström from the Stockholm Resilience Centre. The core problem this pattern addresses is the increasing human pressure on the Earth's systems, which risks generating large-scale, abrupt, or irreversible environmental changes. By defining these boundaries, the framework provides a crucial guide for sustainable development, allowing societies to thrive for generations to come while respecting the planet's limits. The origin of this pattern lies in the scientific community's growing concern over the escalating impacts of human activities on the environment and the need for a more holistic and integrated approach to understanding and managing these impacts.

### 2. Core Principles

The Planetary Boundaries framework is built upon nine core principles, each representing a critical Earth system process that is essential for maintaining the stability and resilience of the planet. These principles are:

1.  **Climate Change:** Limiting the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to avoid dangerous interference with the climate system.
2.  **Change in Biosphere Integrity (Biodiversity Loss and Species Extinction):** Protecting the integrity of ecosystems and the genetic diversity of species, which are crucial for the planet's self-regulation.
3.  **Stratospheric Ozone Depletion:** Maintaining the protective ozone layer in the stratosphere to shield the Earth from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation.
4.  **Ocean Acidification:** Limiting the increase in ocean acidity caused by the uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide, which threatens marine ecosystems.
5.  **Biogeochemical Flows (Nitrogen and Phosphorus Cycles):** Managing the cycles of nitrogen and phosphorus, which are essential for life but can cause widespread pollution if they are excessively altered by human activities.
6.  **Land-System Change:** Protecting forests, wetlands, and other natural landscapes from conversion to other uses, such as agriculture or urban areas.
7.  **Freshwater Use:** Ensuring that freshwater resources are used sustainably and that the ecological functions of rivers, lakes, and groundwater are protected.
8.  **Atmospheric Aerosol Loading:** Limiting the concentration of aerosols (small particles) in the atmosphere, which can affect climate and human health.
9.  **Introduction of Novel Entities:** Managing the release of new substances, such as synthetic chemicals and plastics, that have the potential to disrupt Earth system processes.

### 3. Key Practices

Applying the Planetary Boundaries framework involves a set of key practices that enable organizations to understand their environmental impact and operate within the planet's safe limits. These practices include:

1.  **Materiality Assessment:** Identifying and prioritizing the most significant environmental impacts and dependencies across the organization's value chain. This involves analyzing how the organization's activities affect each of the nine planetary boundaries and, conversely, how changes in these boundaries could affect the organization's performance.

2.  **Baseline Establishment and Target Setting:** Quantifying the organization's current environmental footprint to establish a baseline. Based on this baseline, ambitious and science-based targets are set to reduce the organization's impact and align its operations with the planetary boundaries.
