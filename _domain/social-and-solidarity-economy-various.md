# 1. Overview

The Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE) represents a broad and multifaceted approach to economic organization that prioritizes social and environmental objectives over the singular pursuit of financial profit. It encompasses a diverse range of economic activities, enterprises, and practices that are grounded in values of solidarity, democratic governance, and sustainability. Unlike the traditional private and public sectors, the SSE is distinguished by its commitment to participatory decision-making processes, which empower individuals as active agents of economic and social change. This model is not merely a niche or alternative, but a comprehensive framework for re-embedding the economy in society and nature, striving to create a more just, equitable, and sustainable world.

The SSE is often described as an "umbrella concept" that brings together a variety of organizational forms, including cooperatives, mutual societies, associations, foundations, and social enterprises. These entities, collectively known as Social and Solidarity Economy Organizations and Enterprises (SSEOEs), share a common commitment to placing people and the planet at the center of their activities. They operate across all sectors of the economy, from production and finance to consumption and social services, and are characterized by their innovative solutions to pressing social and environmental challenges. The SSE is not a new phenomenon, with historical roots in the cooperative and mutualist movements of the 19th century, but it has gained renewed attention in recent decades as a response to the social and ecological crises of our time.

# 2. Core Principles

The Social and Solidarity Economy is defined by a set of core principles that guide its diverse practices and organizational forms. These principles, articulated in foundational documents such as the charters of the Intercontinental Network for the Promotion of Social Solidarity Economy (RIPESS) and the Solidarity Economy Network (REAS), emphasize a commitment to human dignity, democratic governance, and ecological sustainability. While the specific expression of these principles may vary across different contexts, they collectively represent a shared vision for an economy that serves people and the planet.

A central tenet of the SSE is **humanism**, which places the human person, their dignity, and their full development at the center of all economic activity. This principle stands in contrast to conventional economic models that often prioritize capital accumulation and profit maximization above all else. The SSE seeks to create an economy that is a tool for human flourishing, not an end in itself. This is closely linked to the principle of **equity**, which recognizes the equal dignity of all people and protects their right to be free from domination and exploitation. It calls for a just and equitable distribution of resources and opportunities, ensuring that the needs of the most vulnerable are met.

**Democratic governance** is another cornerstone of the SSE. This principle is expressed through participatory decision-making processes that empower all stakeholders, including workers, consumers, and community members, to have a voice in the governance of economic enterprises. This commitment to democracy extends beyond the internal governance of individual organizations to the broader economic system, advocating for a democratization of the economy as a whole. The principle of **cooperation**, as opposed to competition, is fundamental to this vision, fostering a culture of mutual support and collective action.

Finally, the SSE is deeply committed to **environmental sustainability**. Recognizing that all economic activity is embedded in and dependent on the natural world, the SSE promotes practices that respect ecological limits and protect biodiversity. This principle calls for a shift away from extractive and polluting modes of production and consumption towards a circular and regenerative economy. The principle of **territorial responsibility** further reinforces this commitment, encouraging organizations to be deeply rooted in their local communities and to contribute to their sustainable development.

# 3. Key Practices

The Social and Solidarity Economy is not just a set of abstract principles; it is a vibrant and diverse field of practice, with a wide range of organizational forms and economic activities that embody its core values. These practices, which are constantly evolving and adapting to new challenges and opportunities, demonstrate the tangible ways in which the SSE is building a more just and sustainable economy from the ground up.

One of the most well-known practices within the SSE is the **cooperative**. Cooperatives are democratically owned and controlled enterprises that are run for the benefit of their members, rather than for the profit of outside investors. They exist in a wide variety of sectors, including agriculture, retail, finance, and housing, and are a powerful tool for empowering workers, consumers, and communities. **Worker cooperatives**, in particular, offer a model for democratizing the workplace, giving workers a direct stake in the ownership and governance of their enterprises.

**Fair trade** is another key practice of the SSE. Fair trade organizations work to create more equitable and sustainable trading relationships between producers in the Global South and consumers in the Global North. By guaranteeing fair prices, decent working conditions, and environmental sustainability, fair trade helps to empower small-scale farmers and artisans and to challenge the injustices of the global trading system. **Ethical purchasing** and **solidarity lending** are related practices that leverage the power of consumers and investors to support businesses and financial institutions that are aligned with the values of the SSE.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in **commons-based peer production**, a new model of production that is based on open collaboration and the sharing of knowledge and resources. This model, which is exemplified by the free and open-source software movement, has the potential to democratize innovation and to create a more inclusive and participatory economy. Other innovative practices within the SSE include **community land trusts (CLTs)** and **limited-equity cooperatives (LECs)**, which are being used to create permanently affordable housing, and **mutual aid networks**, which have emerged as a powerful form of community-based support, particularly in times of crisis.

# 4. Application Context

The Social and Solidarity Economy is not a one-size-fits-all model, but a flexible and adaptable framework that can be applied in a wide variety of contexts. Its principles and practices are relevant to both rural and urban areas, in the Global North and the Global South, and across all sectors of the economy. The specific forms that the SSE takes will vary depending on the particular social, economic, and political context in which it is being implemented.

In many parts of the world, the SSE has emerged as a response to the failures of the mainstream economy to provide decent work, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability. In the Global South, for example, the SSE has a long history of providing essential services and livelihoods for marginalized communities, particularly in the informal economy. In the Global North, the SSE is gaining traction as a response to the growing precarity of work, the erosion of the welfare state, and the urgent need to transition to a low-carbon economy.

The SSE is particularly well-suited to addressing complex social and environmental challenges that cannot be solved by the market or the state alone. For example, the SSE has a proven track record of promoting local economic development, creating green jobs, and providing affordable housing, healthcare, and social services. It is also a powerful tool for empowering women, youth, and other marginalized groups, and for building more inclusive and resilient communities.

# 5. Implementation

Implementing the Social and Solidarity Economy requires a multi-pronged approach that involves a wide range of actors, from grassroots organizations and social movements to governments and international institutions. There is no single blueprint for building the SSE, but there are a number of key strategies and enabling conditions that can help to foster its growth and development.

First and foremost, the SSE requires a supportive legal and policy framework that recognizes its unique characteristics and contributions. This includes laws and regulations that facilitate the creation and operation of SSEOEs, as well as public policies that provide them with access to finance, markets, and technical support. Governments can also play a crucial role in promoting the SSE through their procurement policies, by favoring SSEOEs in the provision of public goods and services.

Second, the SSE needs a vibrant and well-organized civil society to advocate for its interests and to hold governments and other actors accountable. This includes strong and independent networks of SSEOEs, as well as social movements, trade unions, and other organizations that share the values of the SSE. These networks can play a vital role in raising awareness about the SSE, sharing best practices, and mobilizing collective action.

Third, the SSE requires a culture of solidarity and cooperation that extends beyond the boundaries of individual organizations. This includes building alliances and partnerships with a wide range of actors, including local governments, universities, and even private sector businesses that are committed to social and environmental responsibility. By working together, these actors can create a more supportive ecosystem for the SSE and can amplify its impact.

# 6. Evidence & Impact

The Social and Solidarity Economy has a growing body of evidence to support its positive social, economic, and environmental impacts. While the specific impacts of the SSE will vary depending on the context and the type of intervention, research has consistently shown that the SSE can contribute to a wide range of positive outcomes, including poverty reduction, job creation, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability.

In terms of economic impacts, the SSE has been shown to be a significant source of employment and income generation, particularly for marginalized groups. SSEOEs are often more resilient than conventional businesses in times of economic crisis, and they are more likely to reinvest their profits in the local community. The SSE also contributes to a more diverse and resilient economy by promoting local production and consumption and by fostering innovation and entrepreneurship.

In terms of social impacts, the SSE has been shown to be a powerful tool for promoting social inclusion and empowerment. By giving people a voice in the decisions that affect their lives, the SSE can help to build more democratic and cohesive communities. The SSE also plays a crucial role in providing essential social services, such as healthcare, education, and housing, particularly for those who are not well-served by the market or the state.

In terms of environmental impacts, the SSE is at the forefront of the transition to a more sustainable economy. Many SSEOEs are pioneering innovative solutions to environmental challenges, such as renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and waste reduction. By promoting a culture of sufficiency and by prioritizing ecological well-being, the SSE offers a compelling alternative to the unsustainable model of endless growth.

# 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

The transition to the Cognitive Era, characterized by the rise of artificial intelligence, automation, and big data, presents both new opportunities and new challenges for the Social and Solidarity Economy. On the one hand, these new technologies have the potential to democratize access to information, to facilitate new forms of collaboration, and to create new opportunities for social and economic empowerment. On the other hand, they also pose the risk of exacerbating existing inequalities, of concentrating power in the hands of a few, and of creating new forms of surveillance and control.

The SSE has a crucial role to play in shaping the development and governance of these new technologies to ensure that they are used for the benefit of all, not just for the profit of a few. This includes advocating for policies that promote data sovereignty, that protect digital rights, and that ensure that the benefits of automation are shared widely. It also includes developing new models of ownership and governance for digital platforms and data, such as platform cooperatives and data commons.

The SSE can also leverage these new technologies to enhance its own practices and to amplify its impact. For example, digital platforms can be used to connect producers and consumers in new ways, to facilitate the sharing of resources, and to mobilize collective action. Artificial intelligence can be used to optimize the use of resources, to improve the delivery of social services, and to create new tools for participatory decision-making. By embracing these new technologies in a way that is consistent with its core values, the SSE can help to build a more democratic, equitable, and sustainable digital future.

# 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

The Social and Solidarity Economy is deeply aligned with the principles of the commons, a paradigm that emphasizes the shared stewardship of resources and the collective governance of social and ecological systems. The SSE's commitment to democratic governance, social equity, and environmental sustainability makes it a natural ally of the commons movement, and its diverse practices offer a rich source of inspiration for building a more commons-oriented society.

*   **Community & Culture:** The SSE fosters a sense of community and shared identity by bringing people together to work towards common goals. It promotes a culture of solidarity, cooperation, and mutual support, which are essential for the flourishing of the commons.
*   **Governance & Decision-Making:** The SSE is characterized by its commitment to democratic governance and participatory decision-making. This aligns with the principle of self-governance that is at the heart of the commons, and it provides a model for how to manage shared resources in a way that is fair, equitable, and accountable.
*   **Economic & Livelihood:** The SSE provides a framework for creating livelihoods that are not dependent on the whims of the market or the state. By promoting local production and consumption, by fostering entrepreneurship, and by creating new forms of social and economic value, the SSE helps to build more resilient and self-reliant communities.
*   **Knowledge & Learning:** The SSE is a learning-oriented movement that is constantly experimenting with new ideas and practices. It promotes the sharing of knowledge and the co-creation of solutions, which are essential for the ongoing evolution and adaptation of the commons.
*   **Technology & Infrastructure:** The SSE is increasingly engaging with the challenges and opportunities of the digital age. It is developing new models of ownership and governance for digital platforms and data, and it is exploring how to use technology to support the growth and development of the commons.
*   **Ecology & Environment:** The SSE is deeply committed to environmental sustainability. It promotes practices that respect ecological limits, that protect biodiversity, and that contribute to the regeneration of natural systems. This aligns with the principle of ecological stewardship that is central to the commons.
*   **Well-being & Resilience:** The SSE is ultimately about creating a society that promotes the well-being of all its members. By fostering social connection, by promoting a sense of purpose, and by building more resilient and supportive communities, the SSE contributes to the creation of a world where everyone can thrive.
