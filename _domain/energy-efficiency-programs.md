# 1. Overview

Energy Efficiency Programs are structured initiatives designed to improve energy efficiency within a specific population, such as a company, a community, or a customer base. These programs have been a feature of the energy landscape since the late 1980s, evolving from simple utility-run initiatives to sophisticated, multi-faceted efforts delivered by a variety of actors, including utilities, government agencies, and third-party administrators. The fundamental goal of these programs is to overcome the various market, information, and financial barriers that prevent the widespread adoption of energy-efficient technologies and practices. By doing so, they aim to reduce overall energy consumption, lower energy costs for consumers, and mitigate the environmental impact of energy production and use. These programs are increasingly viewed as a cost-effective and reliable energy resource, capable of deferring or even replacing the need for new energy supply infrastructure.

# 2. Core Principles

The success of Energy Efficiency Programs is underpinned by a set of core principles that have been refined over decades of practice. These principles provide a framework for designing and implementing effective programs that deliver measurable and sustainable results.

*   **Energy Efficiency as a Priority Resource:** The foundational principle is the recognition of energy efficiency as a primary energy resource, on par with traditional supply-side resources like power plants. This means that energy efficiency is not just a 'nice-to-have' but a critical component of a modern, resilient, and cost-effective energy system.

*   **Long-Term Commitment and Stable Funding:** Effective programs require a long-term commitment from their sponsors, backed by stable and sufficient funding. This stability allows for long-range planning, fosters market confidence, and enables the development of a skilled workforce and robust supply chains.

*   **Comprehensive and Diverse Portfolio:** Successful programs offer a diverse portfolio of measures and services that cater to all customer classes, from large industrial facilities to individual residential customers. This includes addressing the needs of hard-to-reach segments like low-income households and small businesses.

*   **Market-Based Approach:** Rather than simply providing prescriptive rebates, modern programs increasingly adopt a market-based approach. This involves working with manufacturers, retailers, and contractors to transform the market for energy-efficient products and services, making them the default choice for consumers.

*   **Data-Driven Design and Evaluation:** Program design and implementation should be informed by robust data and analysis, including detailed potential studies to identify the most promising opportunities for energy savings. Continuous monitoring and evaluation are essential to track progress, measure impact, and refine program strategies over time.

*   **Stakeholder Engagement and Collaboration:** Effective programs are built on a foundation of strong stakeholder engagement and collaboration. This includes working closely with customers, trade allies, government agencies, and other key actors to ensure that programs are well-designed, effectively delivered, and widely adopted.

# 2. Core Principles

# 3. Key Practices

Effective Energy Efficiency Programs are characterized by a set of key practices that translate the core principles into tangible actions. These practices are the operational components of a successful program, ensuring that it is well-designed, efficiently delivered, and achieves its intended outcomes.

*   **Leveraging Private Sector Expertise and Financing:** Successful programs often partner with private sector actors, such as Energy Service Companies (ESCOs), to deliver services and leverage external financing. This can include outsourcing program implementation, utilizing third-party financing mechanisms, and working with manufacturers and retailers to promote energy-efficient products.

*   **Building on Proven Program Models:** Rather than reinventing the wheel, new programs can accelerate their development and increase their effectiveness by adapting proven program models from other jurisdictions. This involves starting with successful approaches and tailoring them to local conditions, market characteristics, and customer needs.

*   **Rigorous Monitoring and Evaluation:** A cornerstone of best practice is the integration of robust monitoring and evaluation (M&E) from the outset. This includes process evaluations to optimize program delivery, impact evaluations to measure energy savings and other outcomes, and the use of tracking systems to support both.

*   **Cultivating Leadership and Organizational Alignment:** Making energy efficiency a true resource requires strong leadership at multiple levels, from senior executives to frontline staff. This leadership is essential for building the business case for energy efficiency, securing necessary resources, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

*   **Strategic Energy Efficiency Planning:** A comprehensive energy efficiency plan is a critical tool for guiding program development and implementation. This plan should be based on a thorough understanding of the energy efficiency potential, align with broader organizational goals, and include a roadmap of key milestones and targets.

*   **Market-Oriented Program Design and Delivery:** Programs should be designed with a deep understanding of the target market, including customer needs, motivations, and barriers to adoption. This involves conducting market assessments, soliciting stakeholder input, and using marketing and outreach strategies that resonate with the target audience.

# 4. Application Context

Energy Efficiency Programs are not a one-size-fits-all solution. They are implemented within a variety of policy and market contexts, each with its own unique characteristics and implications for program design and delivery. Understanding these different application contexts is crucial for developing programs that are well-suited to their specific environment.

*   **Systems Benefits Charge (SBC) Model:** In this model, program funding is generated through a small, non-bypassable charge on all customer utility bills. This creates a stable and predictable funding stream that is insulated from the utility's revenue model. Programs can be administered by the utility, a state agency, or a third party. The SBC model is common in restructured electricity markets and has been a key driver of program growth in many states.

*   **Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) Model:** The IRP model treats energy efficiency as a resource that is evaluated on a level playing field with traditional supply-side resources. Utilities are required to develop long-term resource plans that consider all available options for meeting future energy demand, including energy efficiency. This model is most common in vertically integrated utility markets and provides a strong incentive for utilities to invest in cost-effective energy efficiency.

*   **Request for Proposal (RFP) Model:** In the RFP model, a utility or other entity issues a competitive solicitation for energy efficiency resources from third-party providers. This market-based approach can be used to acquire a specific amount of energy savings or to target specific geographic areas or customer segments. The RFP model is often used to address transmission and distribution constraints or to meet peak demand reduction goals.

*   **Portfolio Standard Model:** This model establishes a mandatory requirement for utilities or other program administrators to achieve a certain level of energy savings, typically expressed as a percentage of energy sales. The portfolio standard can be a powerful driver of program activity, but it needs to be carefully designed to ensure that it is cost-effective and achievable.

*   **Municipal Utility/Electric Cooperative Model:** Municipal utilities and electric cooperatives are not-for-profit entities that are owned by their customers. This ownership structure can create a strong alignment of interests between the utility and its customers, making it easier to justify investments in energy efficiency. These utilities often have a close relationship with their communities and can be effective at delivering programs that are tailored to local needs.

# 5. Implementation

Implementing a successful Energy Efficiency Program is a multi-stage process that requires careful planning, execution, and continuous improvement. The following steps provide a general framework for implementing such a program, drawing on the best practices identified in the preceding sections.

**1. Leadership and a Long-Term Commitment:** The first and most critical step is to secure strong leadership and a long-term commitment to energy efficiency. This involves building a compelling business case for energy efficiency, educating key stakeholders, and establishing a supportive policy and regulatory framework. Without this foundational commitment, even the best-designed programs are unlikely to succeed.

**2. Conduct a Comprehensive Potential Study:** Before launching a program, it is essential to conduct a thorough potential study to identify and quantify the opportunities for energy savings. This study should assess the technical, economic, and market potential for energy efficiency across all customer classes and end uses. The results of the potential study will provide the basis for setting realistic program goals and designing a cost-effective portfolio of programs.

**3. Develop a Strategic Energy Efficiency Plan:** Based on the findings of the potential study, the next step is to develop a strategic energy efficiency plan. This plan should serve as a roadmap for program implementation, outlining the program's goals, objectives, strategies, and budget. It should also include a detailed timeline for program launch and a plan for monitoring and evaluation.

**4. Design a Diverse and Market-Oriented Program Portfolio:** With a strategic plan in place, the focus shifts to designing a diverse portfolio of programs that are tailored to the needs of different customer segments. This includes a mix of prescriptive and custom programs, as well as programs that target specific technologies, end uses, or market actors. The design process should be informed by market research and stakeholder input to ensure that the programs are relevant, accessible, and appealing to the target audience.

**5. Secure Stable and Adequate Funding:** A critical element of successful implementation is securing a stable and adequate source of funding. As discussed in the Application Context section, this can come from a variety of sources, including system benefits charges, ratepayer-funded utility budgets, and competitive solicitations. The key is to ensure that the funding is sufficient to support the program's goals and that it is predictable over the long term.

**6. Build a Robust Delivery Infrastructure:** Effective program delivery requires a robust infrastructure of people, processes, and systems. This includes hiring and training qualified staff, developing streamlined program workflows, and implementing a comprehensive tracking and reporting system. It also involves building strong relationships with trade allies, such as contractors, retailers, and distributors, who are often the primary channel for delivering energy efficiency services to customers.

**7. Implement a Rigorous Monitoring and Evaluation Framework:** From the very beginning, it is crucial to implement a rigorous monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework to track program performance and measure its impact. This includes both process evaluations, which assess the efficiency and effectiveness of program delivery, and impact evaluations, which quantify the energy savings and other benefits of the program. The results of the M&E process should be used to continuously improve program design and delivery.

# 6. Evidence & Impact

The evidence for the effectiveness of Energy Efficiency Programs is extensive and well-documented. For decades, these programs have been delivering significant energy savings, economic benefits, and environmental improvements across a wide range of jurisdictions and program models. The data clearly shows that energy efficiency is a reliable, cost-effective, and scalable resource that can play a critical role in meeting our future energy needs.

**Energy Savings and Cost-Effectiveness:**

Numerous studies have demonstrated the substantial energy savings and cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency programs. For example, a review of programs across the United States found that they are consistently delivering electricity savings at a cost of around $0.02 to $0.03 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) saved, which is significantly lower than the cost of new electricity generation. Similarly, natural gas programs are achieving savings at a cost of $0.30 to $2.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) saved, which is also highly cost-effective compared to the price of natural gas.

**Economic Benefits:**

The economic benefits of energy efficiency programs extend far beyond the direct energy savings. By reducing energy waste, these programs lower energy bills for homes and businesses, freeing up disposable income and improving business competitiveness. They also create local jobs in the energy efficiency industry, from manufacturing and distribution to installation and maintenance. Furthermore, by reducing the need for new energy infrastructure, energy efficiency can help to stabilize energy prices and reduce the overall cost of the energy system.

**Environmental Benefits:**

Energy efficiency is one of the most effective and lowest-cost ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air pollution. By reducing energy consumption, these programs avoid the environmental impacts associated with energy production, including air and water pollution, habitat destruction, and carbon emissions. The environmental benefits of energy efficiency are a key driver of program investment in many jurisdictions, particularly those with ambitious climate and clean energy goals.

# 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

The Cognitive Era, characterized by the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and the Internet of Things (IoT), is poised to revolutionize the field of energy efficiency. These technologies offer unprecedented opportunities to enhance the design, delivery, and impact of Energy Efficiency Programs, moving them from a model of periodic, manual interventions to one of continuous, automated optimization.

**AI and Machine Learning for Predictive Analytics:**

AI and ML algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data from smart meters, building management systems, and other sources to identify patterns and predict future energy consumption. This enables a more proactive and targeted approach to energy efficiency, allowing program administrators to identify the most promising opportunities for savings and to tailor interventions to the specific needs of individual customers. For example, ML models can be used to predict which customers are most likely to respond to a particular program offer, or to identify buildings that are performing poorly and in need of a retro-commissioning.

**IoT for Real-Time Monitoring and Control:**

The proliferation of low-cost IoT sensors and devices is making it possible to monitor and control energy consumption in real time. This enables a wide range of new energy efficiency applications, from smart thermostats that learn a homeowner's preferences and automatically adjust the temperature, to sophisticated building automation systems that continuously optimize lighting, heating, and cooling in commercial buildings. By providing granular, real-time data on energy use, IoT is also a key enabler of measurement and verification (M&V) 2.0, which promises to make it easier and cheaper to quantify the savings from energy efficiency investments.

**The Rise of the Smart Grid:**

The development of the smart grid, which integrates advanced communication and control technologies into the electricity grid, is creating new opportunities for energy efficiency to provide grid services. For example, by aggregating and controlling a large number of distributed energy resources, such as smart appliances and electric vehicles, it is possible to provide demand response, frequency regulation, and other services that help to balance the grid and integrate renewable energy. This is transforming energy efficiency from a passive resource that simply reduces load to an active resource that can be dispatched to meet the needs of the grid.

**Challenges and Opportunities:**

The transition to a more intelligent and automated energy system also presents a number of challenges. These include the need for new data standards and communication protocols, the development of new business models and regulatory frameworks, and the management of data privacy and cybersecurity risks. However, the opportunities are immense. By embracing the technologies of the Cognitive Era, Energy Efficiency Programs can become more effective, more scalable, and more valuable than ever before.

# 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

This assessment evaluates the alignment of Energy Efficiency Programs with the principles of a commons-based approach, considering how the pattern contributes to shared resources, collaborative governance, and equitable access to benefits. The assessment is based on seven key dimensions of commons alignment, with a score from 1 (low alignment) to 5 (high alignment) for each dimension.

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Openness & Accessibility** | 3 | While many programs are open to all customers within a given service territory, access can be limited by factors such as income, housing tenure (renter vs. owner), and awareness. Efforts to reach low-income and other underserved communities are increasing, but are not yet universal. |
| **2. Community & Collaboration** | 4 | Effective programs are built on a foundation of collaboration between utilities, government agencies, community organizations, and private sector actors. They foster a sense of shared purpose around the goal of energy efficiency and can help to build social capital within communities. |
| **3. Sustainability & Resilience** | 4 | Energy efficiency is a cornerstone of environmental sustainability, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of pollution. By lowering overall energy demand, it also enhances the resilience of the energy system, making it less vulnerable to supply disruptions and price shocks. |
| **4. Fairness & Equity** | 2 | The distribution of program benefits can be inequitable, with wealthier households and larger businesses often better able to take advantage of program offerings. This is a significant challenge for program administrators, and there is a growing recognition of the need to design programs that are more inclusive and equitable. |
| **5. Decentralization & Autonomy** | 2 | While some aspects of energy efficiency are inherently decentralized (e.g., individual actions to reduce energy use), the programs themselves are often centrally administered by utilities or government agencies. There is a tension between the need for centralized coordination and the desire to empower local communities to take control of their energy future. |
| **6. Transparency & Accountability** | 3 | Most programs are subject to some form of regulatory oversight, and there is a growing emphasis on transparency and accountability. However, the complexity of program design and evaluation can make it difficult for the public to fully understand and assess program performance. |
| **7. Knowledge & Learning** | 4 | Energy efficiency programs are a significant source of knowledge and learning about how to save energy. They support research and development, collect vast amounts of data on energy use, and help to educate the public about the benefits of energy efficiency. |

**Overall Commons Alignment Score: 2/5**

While Energy Efficiency Programs have strong potential to align with commons principles, particularly in the areas of sustainability and collaboration, their overall alignment is limited by challenges related to fairness, equity, and decentralization. The centralized, top-down nature of many programs, combined with the unequal distribution of benefits, runs counter to the ideals of a commons-based approach. To improve their commons alignment, programs will need to place a greater emphasis on community engagement, equitable access, and the empowerment of local actors.
