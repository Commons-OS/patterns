# Unschooling

## 1. Overview

Unschooling is an informal learning that advocates learner-chosen activities as a primary means for learning. Unschoolers learn through their natural life experiences including play, household responsibilities, personal interests and curiosity, internships and work experience, travel, books, elective classes, family, mentors, and social interaction. Unschooling encourages exploration of activities initiated by the children themselves, believing that the more personal learning is, the more meaningful, well-understood, and therefore useful it is to the child. While courses of study may be occasionally chosen by the child, unschoolers question the usefulness of a standard curriculum, conventional grading methods, and other features of traditional schooling in the education of each unique child.

## 2. Core Principles

Unschooling is based on a number of core principles, which include:

*   **Learning is a natural process:** Unschooling is based on the idea that children are born with a natural curiosity and desire to learn. It asserts that they do not need to be forced or coerced into learning.
*   **Child-led learning:** In unschooling, the child takes the lead in deciding what, how, and when they want to learn. This approach allows them to pursue their own interests and passions, which makes learning more meaningful and engaging.
*   **Learning through real-life experiences:** Unschoolers learn through their everyday experiences, such as playing, exploring, and participating in family and community life. They do not rely on textbooks or formal lessons to acquire knowledge.
*   **No fixed curriculum or timetable:** Unschooling does not follow a predetermined curriculum or schedule. Learning happens organically, based on the child's interests and needs.
*   **Focus on the whole person:** Unschooling is not just about academic learning. It is also about developing the child's social, emotional, and physical well-being.
*   **Trust in children:** Unschooling parents trust their children to learn and grow without constant supervision and direction. They believe that children are capable of making their own decisions and taking responsibility for their own learning.
*   **A rich and stimulating environment:** Unschooling parents create a home environment that is rich in resources and opportunities for learning. This may include books, art supplies, musical instruments, and access to the internet.
*   **A partnership between parents and children:** Unschooling is a collaborative process between parents and children. Parents act as facilitators and guides, rather than teachers.
*   **A lifelong love of learning:** The goal of unschooling is to foster a lifelong love of learning in children. Unschoolers believe that learning should be a joyful and exciting experience.

## 3. Key Practices

There are a number of key practices that are common in unschooling families. These include:

*   **Strewing:** This involves leaving interesting things around for children to discover on their own. It could be a book, a game, a science experiment, or anything else that might spark their curiosity.
*   **Field trips:** Unschoolers often take field trips to museums, parks, and other places of interest. This allows children to learn about the world in a hands-on way.
*   **Mentorships:** Unschoolers may seek out mentors who can teach them about specific skills or subjects. This could be a family member, a friend, or a professional in the community.
*   **Volunteering:** Volunteering is a great way for unschoolers to learn new skills, meet new people, and make a difference in their communities.
*   **Travel:** Travel is a powerful learning experience for unschoolers. It exposes them to new cultures, languages, and ways of life.
*   **Reading:** Unschoolers are often avid readers. They read for pleasure, to learn about new things, and to expand their horizons.
*   **Playing:** Play is an essential part of unschooling. It is through play that children learn about themselves, the world around them, and how to interact with others.
*   **Conversation:** Unschoolers have a lot of conversations with their parents, siblings, and other people in their lives. This is how they learn to think critically, express themselves clearly, and understand different perspectives.

## 4. Application Context

Unschooling can be applied in a variety of contexts, but it is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It is most likely to be successful in families who are committed to the philosophy and who are willing to put in the time and effort to create a rich and stimulating learning environment for their children. Unschooling may not be a good fit for all children or all families. For example, children on the autism spectrum may need more structure and support than unschooling can provide. In order to make unschooling work, families need access to enriching public institutions, like museums and zoos. Unschooling works best when the family is well-connected to the larger community.

## 5. Implementation

Implementing unschooling can be a gradual process. Here are some steps to get started:

1.  **Deschooling:** This is the process of deprogramming yourself and your children from the traditional school mindset. It can take some time to let go of the idea that learning only happens in a classroom and that it must be structured and teacher-directed. During this time, it is important to simply relax and enjoy spending time together as a family.
2.  **Observation:** Pay attention to your children’s interests and passions. What do they love to do? What are they curious about? This will give you clues about how to support their learning.
3.  **Strewing:** As you observe your children’s interests, you can start to strew their environment with things that will spark their curiosity. This could be books, games, art supplies, or anything else that you think they might enjoy.
4.  **Facilitating:** As your children begin to explore their interests, your role is to facilitate their learning. This may involve helping them find resources, connecting them with mentors, or simply being a sounding board for their ideas.
5.  **Trusting:** The most important part of unschooling is to trust your children. Trust that they are capable of learning and that they will learn what they need to know when they need to know it.

## 6. Evidence & Impact

There is a growing body of research on the outcomes of unschooling. While much of the early research was qualitative and based on small sample sizes, more recent studies have used larger samples and more rigorous methods. The findings of this research are generally positive, suggesting that unschooling can be a successful educational option for many children.

One of the most comprehensive studies on unschooling was conducted by Peter Gray and Gina Riley. They surveyed 232 families who had chosen to unschool their children. The study found that unschooling families were diverse in terms of their income, education, and religious beliefs. The study also found that unschooled children were more likely to be involved in their communities and to have a wide range of interests.

Another study, conducted by Peter Gray, surveyed 75 grown unschoolers. The study found that the vast majority of unschoolers were happy with their decision to unschool and that they felt well-prepared for life after high school. Many of the unschoolers in the study had gone on to college and had successful careers.

Overall, the research on unschooling suggests that it can be a viable and successful educational option for many children. However, it is important to note that unschooling is not for everyone. It requires a great deal of commitment from parents and a willingness to trust children to take the lead in their own learning.

## 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

In the cognitive era, where information is abundant and the nature of work is constantly evolving, unschooling is more relevant than ever. The skills that are most valued in the 21st-century economy are not the ones that are typically taught in traditional schools. Instead, they are skills like creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, and communication. These are the very skills that are nurtured in an unschooling environment.

Unschoolers are well-prepared for the future of work because they are self-directed learners who are able to adapt to new situations and technologies. They are also more likely to be intrinsically motivated and to have a lifelong love of learning. In a world where people are likely to have multiple careers over the course of their lives, the ability to learn and relearn is essential.

Furthermore, unschooling is a more human-centered approach to education. It recognizes that every child is unique and that they learn best when they are able to pursue their own interests and passions. In a world that is becoming increasingly automated, the ability to be creative and to think outside the box will be more important than ever.

## 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

Unschooling has a complex relationship with the commons. On the one hand, it can be seen as a way of reclaiming education from the state and the market and creating a more community-based approach to learning. On the other hand, it can also be seen as a retreat from the public sphere and a form of privatization.

**1. Openness and Inclusivity:** Unschooling is, in principle, open to everyone. However, in practice, it is often limited to families who have the time, resources, and cultural capital to support it. This can create a barrier to entry for families from lower-income backgrounds or from marginalized communities.

**2. Participation and Governance:** Unschooling is a highly participatory form of education. Children are actively involved in their own learning, and parents are deeply engaged in their children’s education. However, there is no formal governance structure for unschooling, which can make it difficult to ensure quality and accountability.

**3. Knowledge and Culture:** Unschooling promotes a more diverse and decentralized approach to knowledge and culture. Unschoolers are not limited to the standard curriculum, and they are free to explore a wide range of topics and ideas. This can lead to a more vibrant and dynamic learning environment.

**4. Technology and Infrastructure:** Unschooling is increasingly reliant on technology and infrastructure, such as the internet and public libraries. This can create a digital divide between those who have access to these resources and those who do not.

**5. Economy and Sustainability:** Unschooling can be a more sustainable form of education than traditional schooling. It is less resource-intensive, and it can be more responsive to the needs of the local community. However, it can also be a challenge for parents to balance the demands of unschooling with the need to earn a living.

**6. Law and Policy:** The legal and policy framework for unschooling varies from state to state. In some states, it is relatively easy to unschool, while in others, it is more difficult. This can create a patchwork of regulations that can be confusing and difficult to navigate.
	
**7. Social and Environmental Impact:** Unschooling can have a positive social and environmental impact. Unschoolers are more likely to be engaged in their communities and to be environmentally conscious. However, there is also a risk that unschooling can lead to social isolation and a lack of exposure to diverse perspectives.

## The Philosophy of Unschooling

The philosophy of unschooling is rooted in the belief that children are natural learners who are capable of directing their own education. Unschoolers believe that learning is not something that should be confined to a classroom or dictated by a curriculum. Instead, they believe that learning should be a lifelong pursuit that is integrated into all aspects of life.

Unschooling is not a new concept. It has its roots in the work of educational reformers like John Holt, who argued that the traditional school system was failing to meet the needs of children. Holt believed that children were being turned off to learning by the rigid and authoritarian nature of schools. He argued that children should be given the freedom to learn in their own way and at their own pace.

Unschooling is not just about education. It is also a philosophy of parenting. Unschooling parents believe that children should be treated with respect and that their opinions should be valued. They believe that children should be given the freedom to make their own choices and to learn from their own mistakes.

Unschooling is not for everyone. It requires a great deal of trust and a willingness to let go of control. It also requires a commitment to creating a rich and stimulating learning environment for your children. However, for those who are willing to embrace it, unschooling can be a rewarding and transformative experience.
