### 1. Overview (150-300 words)

A cooperative is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise. The core problem that cooperatives solve is the alienation of ownership from labor and the extraction of value for the sole benefit of capital. By placing ownership and control in the hands of the members who use the cooperative's services, the value created is retained and distributed among those who generate it. The origin of the modern cooperative movement is attributed to the Rochdale Pioneers, a group of 28 artisans in Rochdale, England, who in 1844 formulated the Rochdale Principles to govern their cooperative. Their primary motivation was to provide affordable, high-quality food to their members in response to the exploitative practices of company-owned stores during the Industrial Revolution. These principles, which have been updated and adapted over time, continue to form the foundation of the cooperative movement worldwide, emphasizing values of self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity, and solidarity.

### 2. Core Principles (3-7 principles, 200-400 words)

1.  **Voluntary and Open Membership:** Cooperatives are voluntary organizations, open to all persons able to use their services and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, without gender, social, racial, political or religious discrimination. [2]

2.  **Democratic Member Control:** Cooperatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions. Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. In primary cooperatives members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) and cooperatives at other levels are also organized in a democratic manner. [2]

3.  **Member Economic Participation:** Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their cooperative. At least part of that capital is usually the common property of the cooperative. Members usually receive limited compensation, if any, on capital subscribed as a condition of membership. Members allocate surpluses for any or all of the following purposes: developing their cooperative, possibly by setting up reserves, part of which at least would be indivisible; benefiting members in proportion to their transactions with the cooperative; and supporting other activities approved by the membership. [2]

4.  **Autonomy and Independence:** Cooperatives are autonomous, self-help organizations controlled by their members. If they enter into agreements with other organizations, including governments, or raise capital from external sources, they do so on terms that ensure democratic control by their members and maintain their cooperative autonomy. [2]

5.  **Education, Training, and Information:** Cooperatives provide education and training for their members, elected representatives, managers, and employees so they can contribute effectively to the development of their co-operatives. They inform the general public – particularly young people and opinion leaders – about the nature and benefits of co-operation. [2]

6.  **Cooperation among Cooperatives:** Cooperatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the cooperative movement by working together through local, national, regional and international structures. [2]

7.  **Concern for Community:** Cooperatives work for the sustainable development of their communities through policies approved by their members. [2]

### 3. Key Practices (5-10 practices, 300-600 words)

1.  **Member-Owner Governance:** Members actively participate in the governance of the cooperative, electing a board of directors from among their own ranks. This ensures that the cooperative is accountable to its members and that its policies and decisions reflect their interests. For example, at the REI co-op, members vote for the board of directors. [1]

2.  **Patronage Dividends:** Surpluses, or profits, are returned to members in proportion to their use of the cooperative's services. This practice, known as patronage dividends, reinforces the principle of member economic participation and ensures that the benefits of the cooperative are shared equitably. For example, many credit unions return a portion of their profits to members in the form of dividends. [2]

3.  **Cooperative Federation:** Cooperatives often form federations with other cooperatives to achieve common goals, such as marketing, purchasing, and advocacy. This practice of cooperation among cooperatives strengthens the cooperative movement and enables cooperatives to compete more effectively with traditional businesses. For example, the National Cooperative Grocers (NCG) is a cooperative federation of retail food co-ops in the United States. [2]

4.  **Community Investment:** Cooperatives often invest in their local communities, supporting local businesses, creating jobs, and contributing to the social and economic well-being of the community. This practice reflects the cooperative principle of concern for community and demonstrates the commitment of cooperatives to sustainable development. For example, many rural electric cooperatives have invested in broadband infrastructure to bring high-speed internet to underserved areas. [1]

5.  **Employee Ownership:** In worker cooperatives, the employees are the owners of the business. This model of employee ownership empowers workers, giving them a voice in the management of the business and a share in its profits. For example, Equal Exchange is a worker-owned cooperative that sells fair trade coffee, tea, and chocolate. [4]

6.  **Multi-Stakeholder Models:** Some cooperatives have multiple classes of members, such as consumers, workers, and producers. This multi-stakeholder model allows for a more inclusive and democratic form of governance, balancing the interests of different stakeholder groups. For example, the Eroski Group in Spain is a multi-stakeholder cooperative with both worker and consumer members. [1]

7.  **Platform Cooperativism:** This is a growing movement to build cooperatively-owned online platforms for work, commerce, and social networking. Platform cooperatives offer an alternative to the extractive business models of many Silicon Valley platforms, giving workers and users more control over their data and the value they create. For example, Stocksy United is a platform cooperative that is owned and governed by its artists. [1]

### 4. Application Context (200-300 words)

- **Best Used For**:
    - **Shared Services:** When a group of individuals or small businesses can benefit from pooling resources to access services they couldn't afford individually, such as marketing, purchasing, or back-office support. [3]
    - **Community-Based Enterprises:** For ventures that aim to serve a specific community's needs, such as a local grocery store, credit union, or housing complex, where the members are the primary users. [1]
    - **Worker Empowerment:** In businesses where employees want to have a direct stake in the ownership, governance, and financial success of the company they work for. [4]
    - **Producer Collaboration:** For independent producers, such as farmers or artisans, who want to collectively process, market, and distribute their products to reach larger markets and achieve economies of scale. [1]

- **Not Suitable For**:
    - **High-Risk, Speculative Ventures:** The democratic and consensus-based nature of cooperatives can be slow to adapt to rapidly changing markets or to make high-risk decisions that require significant speculative investment.
    - **Businesses Requiring Centralized Control:** Industries that demand a top-down, command-and-control management structure for efficiency or safety reasons may not be a good fit for the distributed authority model of a cooperative.

- **Scale**: Individual, Team, Department, Organization, Multi-Organization, Ecosystem

- **Domains**: Agriculture, Retail, Finance (Credit Unions), Housing, Utilities, Healthcare, Insurance, and increasingly in the digital economy through Platform Cooperatives. [1]

### 5. Implementation (400-600 words)

- **Prerequisites**:
    - **A Committed Founding Group:** A cooperative begins with a group of people who share a common need and are willing to work together to meet it. This group must be willing to invest the time, effort, and resources required to start and grow the cooperative. [5]
    - **A Clear Business Plan:** A well-developed business plan is essential for any new venture, and cooperatives are no exception. The business plan should include a market analysis, a financial plan, and a governance plan. [5]
    - **Legal and Financial Expertise:** Starting a cooperative requires legal and financial expertise. The founding group should seek the advice of a lawyer and an accountant who are familiar with cooperative law and finance. [5]

- **Getting Started**:
    - **Form a Steering Committee:** The first step is to form a steering committee to lead the organizing effort. The steering committee should be composed of a diverse group of people who are committed to the cooperative's vision. [5]
    - **Conduct a Feasibility Study:** The steering committee should conduct a feasibility study to determine whether there is a market for the cooperative's products or services and whether the cooperative is financially viable. [5]
    - **Develop a Business Plan:** Based on the results of the feasibility study, the steering committee should develop a comprehensive business plan. [5]
    - **Incorporate the Cooperative:** Once the business plan is complete, the steering committee can incorporate the cooperative. This involves filing articles of incorporation with the state and adopting bylaws to govern the cooperative. [5]
    - **Recruit Members and Raise Capital:** With the cooperative legally established, the steering committee can begin to recruit members and raise the capital needed to start the business. [5]

- **Common Challenges**:
    - **Access to Capital:** Cooperatives often have difficulty accessing capital, as they are not able to issue stock to outside investors. This can make it challenging to finance start-up costs and to fund expansion. [1]
    - **Member Apathy:** If members are not actively involved in the governance of the cooperative, it can become a cooperative in name only, with a small group of people making all the decisions. [2]
    - **Lack of Public Understanding:** Many people are not familiar with the cooperative business model, which can make it difficult to attract members and to market the cooperative's products or services. [2]

- **Success Factors**:
    - **A Strong and Engaged Membership:** The success of a cooperative depends on the active participation of its members. Members must be willing to invest their time, effort, and resources in the cooperative and to hold the board and management accountable. [2]
    - **A Clear and Compelling Vision:** A cooperative must have a clear and compelling vision that inspires its members and guides its decisions. This vision should be based on the cooperative's values and principles and should be communicated effectively to all stakeholders. [2]
    - **A Sound Business Strategy:** A cooperative must have a sound business strategy that enables it to compete effectively in the marketplace and to generate a surplus that can be reinvested in the cooperative or returned to members. [5]

### 6. Evidence & Impact (300-500 words)

- **Notable Adopters**:
    - **Mondragon Corporation (Spain):** One of the largest and most successful worker cooperative federations in the world, with a diverse portfolio of businesses in finance, industry, retail, and knowledge. [1]
    - **The Co-operative Group (UK):** A large consumer cooperative with interests in food, retail, insurance, and legal services, known for its commitment to ethical and sustainable business practices. [1]
    - **REI (USA):** A popular consumer cooperative that sells outdoor recreational gear, clothing, and services. It is known for its strong brand and its commitment to environmental stewardship. [1]
    - **Ocean Spray (USA):** A well-known agricultural cooperative of cranberry and grapefruit growers, which has a significant share of the North American juice market. [1]
    - **State Farm (USA):** A large mutual insurance company that is owned by its policyholders. It is one of the largest providers of auto and home insurance in the United States. [1]

- **Documented Outcomes**:
    - **Increased Business Longevity:** Studies have shown that cooperative businesses have a higher survival rate than traditional businesses, particularly in their early years. [4]
    - **Greater Economic Equality:** By distributing profits to members and employees, cooperatives can help to reduce income inequality and to build a more equitable economy. [4]
    - **Enhanced Community Resilience:** Cooperatives are often more rooted in their local communities than traditional businesses, and they are more likely to reinvest their profits locally, which can help to build more resilient and sustainable local economies. [1]

- **Research Support**:
    - **The International Co-operative Alliance (ICA):** The ICA is a global network of cooperatives that promotes the cooperative model and provides research and resources to support the development of cooperatives. [2]
    - **The University of Wisconsin Center for Cooperatives (UWCC):** The UWCC is a leading research and education center that is dedicated to advancing the understanding of cooperatives. [1]
    - **The Democracy at Work Institute (DAWI):** DAWI is a think tank that promotes the growth of worker cooperatives and other forms of employee ownership. [4]

### 7. Cognitive Era Considerations (200-400 words)

- **Cognitive Augmentation Potential**: AI and automation can significantly enhance the cooperative model by improving decision-making, streamlining operations, and expanding access to information. For example, AI-powered analytics can help cooperatives to better understand their members' needs and preferences, while automation can reduce the administrative burden of managing a cooperative. AI can also help to level the playing field between cooperatives and traditional businesses by providing access to sophisticated tools and technologies that were previously only available to large corporations. [1]

- **Human-Machine Balance**: While AI and automation can augment the cooperative model, they cannot replace the uniquely human element of cooperation. The social and relational aspects of cooperatives, such as trust, solidarity, and democratic participation, are essential to their success and cannot be replicated by machines. The key will be to find the right balance between human and machine, using technology to enhance human capabilities, not to replace them. [2]

- **Evolution Outlook**: In the cognitive era, the cooperative model is likely to evolve in new and exciting ways. We may see the emergence of new forms of cooperatives, such as data cooperatives and AI cooperatives, that are designed to give people more control over their data and the algorithms that shape their lives. We may also see a greater convergence between the cooperative movement and other social movements, such as the open source movement and the commons movement, as people seek to build a more democratic and equitable digital economy. [1]

### 8. Commons Alignment Assessment (600-800 words)

1.  **Stakeholder Mapping**: Cooperatives, by their very nature, have a strong focus on their members, who are the primary stakeholders. However, a comprehensive stakeholder mapping should also include employees, suppliers, customers, the local community, and the environment. The extent to which a cooperative engages with these other stakeholders can vary depending on its size, industry, and mission. For example, a small, local food co-op may have a very close relationship with its suppliers and the local community, while a large, national cooperative may have a more complex and distributed stakeholder network. [1, 2]

2.  **Value Creation**: Cooperatives create value for their members in a variety of ways, including providing access to goods and services at a fair price, creating jobs, and building community wealth. They also create value for society as a whole by promoting economic democracy, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability. The value created by a cooperative is distributed among its members in proportion to their use of the cooperative's services, rather than being extracted for the sole benefit of capital. [1, 2]

3.  **Value Preservation**: Cooperatives are designed to be long-term, sustainable businesses that can serve their members for generations to come. They preserve value by reinvesting their profits in the business, building up reserves, and investing in the education and training of their members and employees. They also preserve value by maintaining their cooperative identity and by adhering to the cooperative principles and values. [2]

4.  **Shared Rights & Responsibilities**: In a cooperative, rights and responsibilities are shared among the members. Members have the right to participate in the governance of the cooperative, to share in its profits, and to use its services. They also have the responsibility to contribute to the capital of the cooperative, to participate in its governance, and to support its mission. [2]

5.  **Systematic Design**: The cooperative model is a systematic design for a business that is based on the principles of democracy, equity, and solidarity. The design of a cooperative is typically specified in its bylaws, which outline the rights and responsibilities of members, the structure of the board, and the procedures for making decisions. [5]

6.  **Systems of Systems**: Cooperatives can be seen as a system of systems, with individual cooperatives forming federations and networks to create a larger cooperative ecosystem. This ecosystem can provide a variety of benefits to its members, including access to shared services, a stronger voice in the marketplace, and a greater sense of solidarity and mutual support. [2]

7.  **Fractal Properties**: The cooperative principles and values can be applied at all levels of the cooperative ecosystem, from the individual member to the global cooperative movement. This fractal property of cooperatives ensures that the cooperative identity is maintained and that the cooperative movement remains a cohesive and powerful force for social and economic change. [2]

**Overall Score**: 5

**Rationale**: The cooperative business model is exemplary in its alignment with the commons. It is a proven and effective model for building a more democratic, equitable, and sustainable economy. By placing ownership and control in the hands of the people who use the business, cooperatives ensure that the value they create is shared among those who generate it, rather than being extracted for the sole benefit of capital. While individual cooperatives may vary in their adherence to the commons principles, the model as a whole is a powerful tool for building a more just and prosperous world.
