# 1. Overview

The Haudenosaunee, meaning "people who build a house," are a confederacy of six Indigenous nations: the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora. Historically known as the Iroquois Confederacy, their sophisticated political and social system, established centuries ago, offers a powerful model for governance, community, and sustainability. This pattern, rooted in the Great Law of Peace, provides a framework for creating resilient, equitable, and harmonious organizational structures. The Haudenosaunee model is not merely a historical artifact; it is a living tradition that continues to guide its people and offers profound insights for contemporary organizations seeking to build more just and effective systems.

The Haudenosaunee Confederacy is founded on the principles of peace, equity, and the power of reason. Their governance structure, a participatory democracy with a clear separation of powers, predates and influenced the United States Constitution. The society is matrilineal, with women holding significant social and political power, including the authority to appoint and depose leaders. This emphasis on balance, consensus-based decision-making, and long-term thinking—famously encapsulated in the Seventh Generation Principle—provides a robust alternative to the hierarchical and short-term-oriented models prevalent in many modern organizations.

# 2. Core Principles

The Haudenosaunee pattern is built upon a foundation of deeply held principles that have guided their society for centuries. These principles, derived from the Great Law of Peace, are not abstract ideals but are woven into the fabric of daily life and governance.

**The Great Law of Peace (Gayanesshagowa):** This is the constitution of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, a complex system of law and governance that emphasizes the power of reason and peace over force. It outlines a democratic system with a separation of powers, checks and balances, and a process for consensus-based decision-making. The three core principles of the Great Law are:

*   **Righteousness (Garihwiostha):** Acting with justice and fairness, ensuring that all individuals are treated with respect and have a voice.
*   **Health (Skenon):** The concept of a healthy mind, body, and spirit, extending to the well-being of the community and the natural world.
*   **Power (Gashastensha):** The authority of the people, exercised through their chosen representatives and guided by the principles of the Great Law.

**The Seventh Generation Principle:** This principle requires that all decisions be made with consideration for their impact on the seventh generation to come. It fosters a long-term perspective that contrasts sharply with the short-term focus of many modern organizations. This principle encourages sustainability, responsibility, and a deep connection to future generations.

**Matrilineal Society:** Haudenosaunee society is organized around clans, with descent traced through the mother's line. Women hold significant authority, including the responsibility for appointing and removing male leaders (Hoyaneh). This structure ensures a balance of power between men and women and recognizes the vital role of women in the community.

**Consensus-Based Decision-Making:** The Grand Council, the governing body of the Confederacy, operates on the principle of consensus. All decisions must be agreed upon by all fifty Hoyaneh, ensuring that all voices are heard and that decisions are made in the best interest of the entire Confederacy. This process, while sometimes lengthy, fosters unity and commitment to the decisions that are made.

# 3. Key Practices

The principles of the Haudenosaunee are put into action through a set of key practices that shape their social, political, and cultural life. These practices are not rigid rules but are flexible and adaptable, allowing them to be applied in a variety of contexts.

**The Grand Council:** The Grand Council is the central governing body of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. It is composed of fifty Hoyaneh, or chiefs, who are chosen by the Clan Mothers of their respective nations. The Council meets to discuss and make decisions on matters that affect the entire Confederacy, operating on the principle of consensus. The structure of the Grand Council, with its clear roles and responsibilities for each nation, provides a model for creating a balanced and effective governing body.

**The Role of Clan Mothers:** Clan Mothers are the female leaders of the clans. They are responsible for the welfare of their clan members and for selecting and advising the Hoyaneh. The Clan Mothers have the power to remove a Hoyaneh from office if he fails to represent the best interests of his people. This practice ensures that leaders remain accountable to the people they serve.

**The Thanksgiving Address (Gano:nyok):** The Thanksgiving Address is a central part of Haudenosaunee spiritual and social life. It is a long and detailed prayer of thanks to all of creation, from the earth and the waters to the plants, animals, and celestial bodies. The Gano:nyok reinforces the Haudenosaunee worldview of interconnectedness and gratitude, and it serves as a reminder of the people's responsibility to the natural world.

**The Condolence Ceremony:** The Condolence Ceremony is a ritual for mourning the loss of a leader and raising up a new one. It is a powerful and moving ceremony that helps to heal the community and to ensure a smooth transition of leadership. The Condolence Ceremony provides a model for how to deal with loss and change in a way that strengthens the community.

# 4. Application Context

The Haudenosaunee pattern, while deeply rooted in a specific cultural and historical context, offers a set of principles and practices that can be adapted and applied to a wide range of contemporary organizations. Its emphasis on long-term thinking, consensus-based decision-making, and distributed leadership makes it particularly relevant for organizations seeking to become more resilient, equitable, and sustainable.

**Community-Based Organizations:** Non-profits, cooperatives, and other community-based organizations can benefit from the Haudenosaunee model of governance. The emphasis on consensus and the role of Clan Mothers can help to create a more inclusive and participatory decision-making process. The Seventh Generation Principle can guide these organizations in making decisions that are in the best long-term interests of their communities.

**Corporate Governance:** The Haudenosaunee model offers a powerful alternative to the hierarchical and short-term-oriented models of corporate governance that are prevalent today. The principles of the Great Law of Peace can be used to create a more ethical and responsible corporate culture. The concept of the Grand Council can be adapted to create a more balanced and effective board of directors.

**Political and Governmental Organizations:** The Haudenosaunee Confederacy has been a model for democratic governance for centuries. Its influence on the United States Constitution is a testament to the power and sophistication of its political system. The principles of the Great Law of Peace can be used to inform and improve contemporary political and governmental structures, making them more just, equitable, and responsive to the needs of the people.

# 5. Implementation

Implementing the Haudenosaunee pattern in a modern organization requires a shift in mindset and a commitment to its core principles. It is not a matter of simply copying the structures and practices of the Haudenosaunee, but of adapting them to the specific context of the organization. The following are some steps that can be taken to begin this process:

**1. Education and Dialogue:** The first step is to educate the members of the organization about the Haudenosaunee and their system of governance. This can be done through workshops, reading groups, and discussions. It is important to create a space for open and honest dialogue about the principles of the Great Law of Peace and how they can be applied to the organization.

**2. Identify Core Principles:** The organization should identify the core principles of the Haudenosaunee pattern that are most relevant to its own mission and values. These might include the Seventh Generation Principle, consensus-based decision-making, and the importance of balance and harmony.

**3. Adapt and Experiment:** The organization should then begin to adapt and experiment with the practices of the Haudenosaunee. This might involve creating a council of representatives, similar to the Grand Council, or establishing a role for women that is similar to that of the Clan Mothers. It is important to be flexible and to learn from experience.

**4. Foster a Culture of Gratitude and Respect:** The Thanksgiving Address is a powerful reminder of the importance of gratitude and respect for all of creation. Organizations can foster a similar culture by creating their own rituals and practices for expressing gratitude and for acknowledging the interconnectedness of all things.

# 6. Evidence & Impact

The Haudenosaunee Confederacy stands as one of the longest-lasting and most influential Indigenous political and social organizations in North America. Its impact is evident in its own resilience and in its influence on the development of democratic thought and practice in the United States and beyond.

**Longevity and Resilience:** The Haudenosaunee Confederacy has existed for centuries, a testament to the strength and adaptability of its governance structure. Despite the immense pressures of colonization, the Confederacy has maintained its traditional government and continues to be a vital force in the lives of its people. This enduring legacy is powerful evidence of the effectiveness of the Great Law of Peace as a framework for building a resilient and sustainable society.

**Influence on the U.S. Constitution:** The democratic principles of the Great Law of Peace were known to the framers of the United States Constitution. Benjamin Franklin, in particular, was a great admirer of the Haudenosaunee and their system of government. The U.S. Senate formally acknowledged the influence of the Haudenosaunee Great Law of Peace on the U.S. Constitution in a 1987 resolution. This influence can be seen in the concepts of separation of powers, checks and balances, and the federal structure of the U.S. government.

**Contemporary Relevance:** The Haudenosaunee model continues to be a source of inspiration for those seeking to create more just and sustainable organizations. Its emphasis on long-term thinking, consensus-based decision-making, and the importance of women in leadership offers a powerful alternative to the hierarchical and patriarchal models that have dominated Western society. The growing interest in Indigenous knowledge and practices is a sign of the increasing recognition of the value of the Haudenosaunee pattern.

# 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

In the Cognitive Era, an age characterized by information overload, rapid technological change, and complex global challenges, the Haudenosaunee pattern offers a timeless and increasingly relevant framework for navigating complexity and fostering collective intelligence. Its principles and practices provide a powerful antidote to the fragmentation, short-termism, and unsustainable practices of the Industrial Era.

**From Hierarchies to Networks:** The Haudenosaunee model, with its emphasis on distributed leadership and consensus-based decision-making, provides a blueprint for creating more agile and resilient network-based organizations. In the Cognitive Era, the ability to sense and respond to change is critical. The Haudenosaunee system, with its multiple feedback loops and its emphasis on listening to all voices, is well-suited to this dynamic environment.

**From Individualism to Collective Intelligence:** The Haudenosaunee worldview is one of interconnectedness and relationship. The Thanksgiving Address is a powerful expression of this understanding. In the Cognitive Era, the ability to collaborate and to learn from one another is essential. The Haudenosaunee model, with its emphasis on community and consensus, provides a framework for fostering collective intelligence and for making wise decisions in the face of complexity.

**From Short-Termism to Long-Term Stewardship:** The Seventh Generation Principle is perhaps the most radical and most needed of the Haudenosaunee's gifts to the world. In an era of climate change and other existential threats, the need for long-term thinking has never been more urgent. The Seventh Generation Principle provides a moral and practical compass for making decisions that will create a more just and sustainable world for generations to come.

# 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

The Haudenosaunee pattern is deeply aligned with the principles of the commons. Its emphasis on shared resources, collective decision-making, and long-term stewardship provides a powerful model for creating and managing commons-based organizations and systems. The following is an assessment of the Haudenosaunee pattern against seven key dimensions of commons alignment.

| Dimension | Score (1-5) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Shared Purpose & Values** | 5 | The Great Law of Peace provides a powerful shared purpose and a clear set of values that have guided the Haudenosaunee for centuries. The principles of righteousness, health, and power are woven into the fabric of their society and provide a strong foundation for collective action. |
