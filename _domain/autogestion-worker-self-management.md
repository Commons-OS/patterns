### 1. Overview (150-300 words)

Autogestión, or worker self-management, is a model of workplace organization where employees collectively and democratically manage the enterprise. This approach fundamentally alters traditional hierarchical structures, placing decision-making power in the hands of the workforce. The core idea is that those who perform the labor should also control the conditions of their work, the allocation of resources, and the distribution of profits. This model is not merely about employee participation but about genuine control over the means of production and the strategic direction of the organization. It encompasses a spectrum of practices, from direct democracy in small collectives to representative systems in larger enterprises, where workers elect and recall their managers and governing councils. The primary goals of autogestión are to enhance organizational performance by fostering greater autonomy and engagement, improve worker morale by reducing alienation, and create a more equitable distribution of wealth by eliminating the exploitation inherent in the capitalist wage-labor relationship. While often associated with socialist and anarchist movements, its principles have been applied in various contexts, including worker cooperatives, publicly owned enterprises, and even within private companies through co-determination and profit-sharing schemes. [1]

### 2. Core Principles (3-7 principles, 200-400 words)

Worker self-management is founded on a set of core principles that guide its implementation and practice. Worker self-management is founded on a set of core principles that guide its implementation and practice, creating a democratic, equitable, and empowering work environment. The most fundamental of these is **Worker Control**, where workers have ultimate authority over the enterprise, exercised collectively and democratically with each worker having an equal voice in major decisions. This stands in stark contrast to the traditional model where control is held by external shareholders or a managerial elite. Another key principle is **Voluntary Association**, where individuals freely and voluntarily associate to form the enterprise, emphasizing the autonomy and self-determination of workers who come together based on shared goals and values. **Democratic Governance** is also crucial, with decision-making based on democratic principles, typically one-person, one-vote, practiced through direct assemblies, representative councils, or a combination of both. The **Equitable Distribution of Surplus** ensures that the economic surplus (profit) generated by the enterprise is distributed equitably among the workers, rejecting the notion of profit as the property of capital owners and instead seeing it as the collective product of labor. Furthermore, self-managed enterprises are committed to the **Education and Development** of their members, including not only technical skills but also the knowledge and capacity for democratic governance and business management. Many self-managed enterprises also practice **Cooperation among Cooperatives**, cooperating with other similar organizations to build a supportive ecosystem and a broader cooperative economy. Finally, a broader **Community Concern** reflects a commitment to social responsibility and sustainable development, where the enterprise considers its impact on the community and the environment. [1]



### 3. Key Practices (5-10 practices, 300-600 words)

The principles of autogestión are put into practice through a variety of concrete mechanisms and processes designed to facilitate democratic governance, empower workers, and ensure the equitable operation of the enterprise. A key practice is the use of **General Assemblies**, the highest decision-making body in many self-managed enterprises, where all worker-members discuss and vote upon major decisions. For larger enterprises, **Elected and Recallable Councils** are used to manage the day-to-day affairs of the organization, with members being accountable to the general assembly and subject to recall at any time. To break down the division of labor and promote skill development, many self-managed enterprises practice **Job Rotation and Polyvalence**, where workers periodically change roles and learn new skills. **Transparent Information Sharing** is another crucial practice, where all information about the enterprise, including financial data, strategic plans, and performance metrics, is made available to all workers to ensure informed decision-making. The means of production are owned collectively by the workers through **Collective Ownership and Investment**, and decisions about investment and the allocation of capital are made democratically. **Conflict Resolution Mechanisms** are established to provide clear and fair processes for resolving conflicts among workers, typically based on mediation and dialogue. Finally, many self-managed enterprises conduct **Social and Environmental Audits** to assess their impact on the community and the planet, reflecting a commitment to the principle of community concern. [1]



### 4. Application Context (200-300 words)

Autogestión is a versatile model that can be applied in a wide range of contexts, from small-scale artisanal workshops to large industrial enterprises. Historically, it has been most prominent in sectors with a strong tradition of worker organization, such as manufacturing, construction, and agriculture. The “empresas recuperadas” (recovered companies) movement in Argentina, where workers took over and reopened bankrupt factories, provides a powerful example of autogestión in action. [4] In recent years, the principles of worker self-management have also been gaining traction in the knowledge economy, with software development companies, design agencies, and consulting firms adopting more democratic and decentralized forms of organization. The rise of platform cooperatives and the gig economy also presents new opportunities for applying the principles of autogestión to create more equitable and empowering forms of work. The suitability of autogestión depends less on the specific industry and more on the commitment of the workers to the principles of democracy, equality, and cooperation. It is a model that can be adapted to different legal and cultural contexts, and it offers a compelling alternative to the traditional hierarchical model of management in any organization that values human dignity and democratic participation. [3]

### 5. Implementation (400-600 words)

The transition to a self-managed model is a complex process that requires careful planning and a strong commitment from all members of the organization. It is not simply a matter of removing managers and declaring the enterprise to be self-managed. Rather, it involves a fundamental transformation of the organization's culture, structures, and processes. The implementation of autogestión can be broken down into several key stages.

First, there is the **preparatory phase**, which involves educating the workforce about the principles and practices of self-management. This may include workshops, study groups, and visits to other self-managed enterprises. It is also important to develop a shared vision and a set of common goals for the organization. This phase is crucial for building the trust, solidarity, and collective will necessary for a successful transition.

Second, there is the **legal and financial structuring phase**. This involves choosing the appropriate legal form for the enterprise, such as a worker cooperative or a social enterprise. It also involves developing a financial plan and securing the necessary capital for the transition. This may require a combination of member contributions, loans from cooperative banks, and support from government agencies or foundations.

Third, there is the **governance design phase**. This involves designing the democratic structures and processes for the organization. This includes defining the roles and responsibilities of the general assembly, the elected councils, and any specialized committees. It is important to create a system of governance that is both democratic and effective, and that can be adapted over time as the organization evolves.

Fourth, there is the **operational transition phase**. This involves the gradual transfer of management functions from the old hierarchical structure to the new democratic one. This may involve training workers in new skills, such as financial management, marketing, and strategic planning. It is also important to establish new systems for communication, coordination, and conflict resolution.

Finally, there is the **consolidation and development phase**. This involves the ongoing process of learning, adaptation, and improvement. Self-management is not a static model but a dynamic process of collective creation. It requires a continuous commitment to education, participation, and democratic renewal. The challenges of implementing autogestión are significant. They include overcoming the legacy of hierarchical culture, developing the necessary skills and knowledge for self-management, and navigating a hostile legal and economic environment. However, the rewards of a successful transition can be equally significant, including a more engaged and productive workforce, a more equitable distribution of wealth, and a more democratic and humane workplace.

### 6. Evidence & Impact (300-500 words)

The impact of worker self-management has been the subject of extensive research and debate for over a century. The evidence, while mixed and often contested, suggests that self-managed enterprises can be at least as efficient as, and in some cases more efficient than, traditional capitalist firms. Studies of worker cooperatives in various countries have found that they tend to have higher productivity, lower employee turnover, and greater resilience in times of economic crisis.

A classic example is the Mondragon Corporation in the Basque Country of Spain. Founded in 1956, Mondragon is a federation of worker cooperatives that has grown to become one of Spain's largest industrial conglomerates. With over 80,000 worker-members, Mondragon is a testament to the viability of large-scale worker self-management. The corporation has a strong track record of innovation, profitability, and social responsibility. [1]

More recently, the “empresas recuperadas” movement in Argentina has provided a powerful demonstration of the potential of autogestión in a crisis situation. In the wake of the country's economic collapse in 2001, workers took over hundreds of bankrupt factories and reopened them as worker cooperatives. Many of these recovered companies have not only survived but have also thrived, creating jobs and providing essential goods and services to their communities. [4]

The positive impacts of autogestión are not limited to economic performance. Studies have also found that worker self-management can have a profound impact on the well-being of workers. By giving workers greater control over their work, autogestión can reduce alienation, increase job satisfaction, and promote personal and professional development. It can also foster a stronger sense of community and solidarity within the workplace.

However, it is also important to acknowledge the challenges and limitations of autogestión. Self-managed enterprises can be difficult to establish and sustain, and they often face a hostile external environment. They can also be prone to internal conflicts and power struggles. Despite these challenges, the evidence suggests that worker self-management is a viable and desirable alternative to the traditional hierarchical model of management.

### 7. Cognitive Era Considerations (200-400 words)

In the Cognitive Era, characterized by the rise of artificial intelligence, automation, and knowledge work, the principles of autogestión take on a new significance. As routine tasks are increasingly automated, the demand for creativity, critical thinking, and collaborative problem-solving is growing. These are precisely the qualities that worker self-management is designed to foster. In a self-managed enterprise, workers are not cogs in a machine but active participants in the innovation process. They are empowered to experiment, take risks, and learn from their mistakes. This creates a dynamic and adaptive organization that is well-suited to the challenges of the Cognitive Era.

Furthermore, the tools of the Cognitive Era can be used to enhance and scale the practice of autogestión. Digital platforms can facilitate democratic decision-making in large and distributed organizations. AI-powered tools can provide workers with the information and analysis they need to make informed choices. Blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies can be used to create more transparent and accountable forms of governance. The combination of autogestión and cognitive technologies has the potential to create a new generation of highly productive and deeply humane organizations.

However, the Cognitive Era also presents new challenges for worker self-management. The increasing complexity of technology can create new forms of hierarchy and exclusion. The gig economy and the rise of precarious work can undermine the stability and solidarity necessary for autogestión. It is therefore crucial that the implementation of autogestión in the Cognitive Era is guided by a strong commitment to digital literacy, lifelong learning, and the creation of secure and dignified work for all.

### 8. Commons Alignment Assessment (600-800 words)

Autogestión, or worker self-management, demonstrates a strong alignment with the principles of the commons. The commons are shared resources that are managed collectively by a community, rather than being owned privately or controlled by the state. The core principles of the commons, as articulated by scholars such as Elinor Ostrom, include clearly defined boundaries, collective-choice arrangements, monitoring, graduated sanctions, conflict-resolution mechanisms, and minimal recognition of rights to organize. Autogestión embodies many of these principles in the context of the workplace.

A self-managed enterprise can be seen as a form of **economic commons**, where the means of production are collectively owned and managed by the community of workers. The workers themselves define the boundaries of the community and establish the rules for accessing and using the shared resources. This aligns with the principle of **clearly defined boundaries**.

Decision-making in a self-managed enterprise is based on **collective-choice arrangements**, where all members have the right to participate in the governance of the organization. This is a direct application of the democratic principles that are at the heart of the commons. The practice of general assemblies and elected councils ensures that the rules and policies of the enterprise are made by the workers themselves, rather than being imposed from above.

The principles of **monitoring** and **graduated sanctions** are also present in many self-managed enterprises. The transparency of information and the close working relationships in a cooperative environment make it easier to monitor the behavior of members and to identify any free-riding or other forms of opportunistic behavior. When conflicts or rule violations do occur, they are typically addressed through **conflict-resolution mechanisms** that are based on dialogue and peer pressure, rather than hierarchical punishment.

Finally, the principle of **minimal recognition of rights to organize** is central to the philosophy of autogestión. The very existence of a self-managed enterprise is an assertion of the right of workers to organize and to govern their own working lives. By creating a space for democratic self-governance in the workplace, autogestión challenges the dominant paradigm of corporate control and contributes to the broader movement for economic democracy. [5]

Given this strong alignment with the core principles of the commons, Autogestión (Worker Self-Management) is assigned a **Commons Alignment Score of 4 out of 5**. The reason it does not receive a perfect score is that the success of a self-managed enterprise is still often dependent on its ability to compete in a capitalist market economy. This can sometimes lead to a focus on internal efficiency and profitability at the expense of broader social and environmental concerns. However, the inherent democratic and cooperative nature of autogestión provides a strong foundation for building a more just and sustainable economy.
