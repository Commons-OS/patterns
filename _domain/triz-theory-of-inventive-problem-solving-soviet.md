# 1. Overview

TRIZ, a Russian acronym for "Teoriya Resheniya Izobretatelskikh Zadach" (Теория решения изобретательских задач), translates to the "Theory of Inventive Problem Solving." It is a systematic and human-centered methodology for innovation that provides a logical and data-driven approach to problem-solving. Developed by Soviet inventor and science fiction author Genrich Altshuller and his colleagues starting in 1946, TRIZ is based on the analysis of thousands of patents and the identification of patterns in inventive solutions. The core idea behind TRIZ is that inventive principles are universal and can be applied to solve problems across different fields of science and engineering.

Altshuller's research revealed that the process of invention is not a random act of genius but follows a set of identifiable patterns and principles. By understanding and applying these principles, individuals and organizations can enhance their creative and inventive capabilities, leading to more effective and breakthrough solutions. TRIZ provides a structured framework for analyzing problems, identifying contradictions, and applying standardized solutions to overcome them.

# 2. Core Principles

The TRIZ methodology is built upon a foundation of several core principles that guide the problem-solving process. These principles are derived from the extensive analysis of patent data and represent the fundamental concepts of inventive problem-solving.

**1. Contradictions:** At the heart of TRIZ is the concept of contradictions. An inventive problem is one that contains a contradiction, where improving one parameter of a system leads to the worsening of another. TRIZ identifies two types of contradictions:
    *   **Technical Contradictions:** These occur when two technical characteristics of a system are in conflict. For example, increasing the strength of a material (a useful function) may also increase its weight (a harmful function).
    *   **Physical Contradictions:** These occur when a single parameter of a system is required to have opposite values. For example, a container needs to be hot on the inside to cook food but cool on the outside to be handled safely.

**2. 40 Inventive Principles:** To resolve contradictions, TRIZ offers a set of 40 Inventive Principles. These are generic suggestions for solving inventive problems and are applicable across a wide range of domains. The principles are based on the analysis of how inventors have solved similar problems in the past. Some examples of the 40 principles include:
    *   **Segmentation:** Dividing a system into independent parts.
    *   **Taking Out:** Separating an interfering part from a system.
    *   **Local Quality:** Changing a system's structure from uniform to non-uniform.
    *   **Asymmetry:** Changing the shape of an object from symmetrical to asymmetrical.

**3. Ideal Final Result (IFR):** The IFR is a key concept in TRIZ that encourages problem solvers to envision the ultimate solution to a problem, without considering the constraints of the current system. The IFR is a solution where the desired outcome is achieved with no cost, no harm, and no additional complexity. By focusing on the IFR, problem solvers can break free from conventional thinking and identify more innovative solutions.

**4. Laws of Technical System Evolution:** TRIZ posits that technical systems evolve according to a set of predictable patterns or laws. These laws describe the natural progression of technical systems over time and can be used to forecast future trends and identify opportunities for innovation. By understanding these laws, organizations can proactively develop new technologies and products that are aligned with the natural evolution of technical systems.

# 3. Key Practices

The application of TRIZ involves a set of key practices that enable a systematic and structured approach to inventive problem-solving. These practices help problem solvers to analyze problems, identify contradictions, and generate innovative solutions.

**1. Problem Formulation and Analysis:** The first step in the TRIZ methodology is to clearly define and formulate the problem. This involves identifying the system, its components, and the relationships between them. TRIZ provides several tools for problem analysis, including:
    *   **Function Analysis:** This involves identifying the useful and harmful functions of a system and its components.
    *   **Cause-Effect Chain Analysis:** This is a graphical tool for identifying the root causes of a problem.
    *   **Su-Field Analysis:** This is a modeling technique that represents a problem as a system of two substances and a field.

**2. Contradiction Matrix:** The Contradiction Matrix is a key tool in TRIZ for resolving technical contradictions. The matrix is a table that lists 39 standard engineering parameters (e.g., weight, strength, temperature) along the rows and columns. The cells of the matrix contain the numbers of the 40 Inventive Principles that are most likely to resolve the contradiction between the corresponding parameters. By identifying the conflicting parameters in a problem, problem solvers can use the Contradiction Matrix to find the most relevant Inventive Principles to apply.

**3. 40 Inventive Principles:** The 40 Inventive Principles are the heart of TRIZ and provide a set of generic solutions for inventive problems. The principles are based on the analysis of thousands of patents and represent the most common patterns of invention. The principles are not specific to any particular domain and can be applied to a wide range of problems. Some examples of the 40 principles include:
    *   **Segmentation:** Dividing a system into independent parts.
    *   **Taking Out:** Separating an interfering part from a system.
    *   **Local Quality:** Changing a system's structure from uniform to non-uniform.
    *   **Asymmetry:** Changing the shape of an object from symmetrical to asymmetrical.

**4. Substance-Field (Su-Field) Analysis:** Su-Field Analysis is a modeling technique that represents a problem as a system of two substances and a field. The two substances are the tool and the article, and the field is the means by which the tool acts on the article. Su-Field Analysis is used to model problems and to identify standard solutions for improving the system.

**5. Laws of Technical System Evolution:** The Laws of Technical System Evolution are a set of patterns that describe the natural progression of technical systems over time. These laws can be used to forecast future trends and to identify opportunities for innovation. By understanding these laws, organizations can proactively develop new technologies and products that are aligned with the natural evolution of technical systems.
