_A brief introduction to the pattern, its purpose, and key components._

Shape Up is a product development methodology developed and popularized by Basecamp, a company known for its project management software and for challenging conventional wisdom in the software industry. Introduced in 2019 through a free online book by Ryan Singer, Basecamp’s Head of Strategy, Shape Up offers an alternative to more traditional agile frameworks like Scrum and Kanban. It is designed to help teams ship meaningful work on time, reduce uncertainty, and increase team autonomy and satisfaction. The core idea behind Shape Up is to move away from a continuous backlog of tasks and instead work in fixed-length cycles on well-defined, but not overly specified, projects. This approach aims to provide teams with the focus and uninterrupted time they need to build high-quality products.

The methodology is structured around three main phases: **Shaping**, **Betting**, and **Building**. 

The first phase, **Shaping**, is the process of defining and refining project ideas before they are considered for development. This is done by a small, senior group and involves setting a clear appetite (the amount of time the team is willing to spend), defining the core problem, and outlining a solution at the right level of abstraction—not too detailed, not too vague. The second phase, **Betting**, is the process of deciding which shaped projects to work on in the upcoming cycle. This is done at a “betting table” where stakeholders review the pitched projects and make a “bet” on which ones will deliver the most value. The final phase, **Building**, is the six-week cycle where a small, autonomous team of designers and developers takes a single project and builds it from start to finish. The team has full ownership and responsibility for the project and is given the uninterrupted time needed to complete it.

Shape Up is not just a set of practices, but a different way of thinking about product development. It emphasizes fixed time and variable scope, meaning that teams are expected to make trade-offs and cut back on less important features to ship the core of the project within the six-week cycle. This is in contrast to many agile methodologies where time is often extended to accommodate a fixed scope. By giving teams a clear goal, a fixed timeframe, and the autonomy to figure out the details, Shape Up aims to create a more focused, productive, and enjoyable work environment.

## 2. Core Principles

_The fundamental ideas and beliefs that underpin the pattern._

Shape Up is built on a set of core principles that differentiate it from other product development methodologies. These principles are designed to foster a culture of focus, autonomy, and timely delivery. They challenge many of the common practices in the software industry, such as maintaining a perpetual backlog, estimating tasks, and managing teams through daily stand-ups. Instead, Shape Up advocates for a more deliberate and trust-based approach to building products.

At the heart of Shape Up is the idea of **fixed time, variable scope**. This principle dictates that every project is given a fixed time budget, or “appetite,” and the team is expected to deliver a meaningful version of the project within that timeframe. This is a significant departure from the common practice of extending deadlines to accommodate a fixed scope. By capping the time, Shape Up forces teams to make conscious trade-offs and prioritize the most important aspects of a project. This principle is supported by the use of **six-week cycles**, which are long enough to build a substantial feature from start to finish, but short enough to create a sense of urgency and focus. Between each six-week cycle, there is a two-week “cool-down” period, which allows teams to work on smaller tasks, fix bugs, or explore new ideas without the pressure of a major project.

Another key principle is the concept of **shaping before building**. Before any project is considered for development, it goes through a “shaping” process. This is where a small group of senior individuals defines the problem, sets the appetite, and outlines a solution at a high level of abstraction. The goal of shaping is not to create a detailed specification, but to define the key elements of the solution and the boundaries of the project. This ensures that when a project is handed off to a team, it is well-defined and de-risked, but still leaves room for the team to exercise their creativity and problem-solving skills. This leads to the principle of **team autonomy and responsibility**. Once a project is “bet” on, a small, dedicated team of designers and developers is given full ownership of the project for the entire six-week cycle. They are responsible for figuring out the details, managing their own work, and ultimately, delivering a finished product. There are no project managers or daily stand-ups; the team is trusted to self-organize and communicate as needed.

Finally, Shape Up replaces the traditional backlog with the concept of a **betting table**. Instead of a long list of features and tasks that may or may not get done, projects are pitched as “bets” at a betting table. Stakeholders review the pitched projects and decide which ones to invest in for the upcoming cycle. This process forces a more conscious and strategic approach to project selection, ensuring that the team is always working on the most important and valuable projects. Projects that are not chosen are not added to a backlog; they are simply discarded, with the understanding that if an idea is truly important, it will come up again.

## 3. Key Practices

_Specific, actionable techniques and processes that are part of the pattern._

Shape Up is not just a set of principles, but a collection of concrete practices that bring those principles to life. These practices provide a structured yet flexible framework for moving from a raw idea to a shipped product. They cover the entire product development lifecycle, from how ideas are defined and selected to how they are built and delivered. These practices are designed to be practical and adaptable, allowing teams to implement them in a way that best suits their specific context.

One of the most important practices in Shape Up is the **six-week cycle**. This is the fundamental rhythm of the methodology. All major projects are planned and executed within these fixed, six-week time boxes. This practice provides a regular cadence for the team and ensures that there is always a clear deadline to work towards. The six-week cycle is complemented by a **two-week cool-down** period. This is a time for the team to work on smaller tasks, fix bugs, explore new ideas, or simply recharge before the next cycle begins. This practice prevents burnout and provides a space for the kind of work that often gets neglected in a high-pressure project environment.

Before a project can be considered for a cycle, it must be **shaped**. This is a critical practice that involves defining the problem, setting an “appetite” (the amount of time the team is willing to spend), and outlining a solution. The output of the shaping process is a **pitch**, which is a document that clearly and concisely presents the problem, appetite, and solution. The pitch is then brought to the **betting table**, which is a meeting where stakeholders decide which projects to “bet” on for the upcoming cycle. This practice replaces the traditional backlog and ensures that project selection is a deliberate and strategic process.

Once a project is selected, a small, autonomous team is assigned to **build** it. The team is given the full six weeks to work on the project without interruption. They are responsible for managing their own work and making the necessary trade-offs to deliver the project on time. To help with this, Shape Up introduces the concept of the **Hill Chart**. This is a visual tool that helps the team track their progress and identify where they are in the problem-solving process. The Hill Chart is divided into two phases: the “uphill” phase, where the team is still figuring things out and exploring the problem, and the “downhill” phase, where the solution is clear and the team is focused on execution. This practice provides a more nuanced and realistic way of tracking progress than a simple list of tasks.

## 4. Application Context

_The types of situations, environments, or problems for which this pattern is well-suited._

Shape Up is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It is a specific methodology that is best suited for certain types of teams, projects, and organizational cultures. Understanding the ideal application context for Shape Up is crucial for its successful implementation. While some of its principles and practices can be adapted to different environments, the full methodology is most effective when there is a strong alignment between its core tenets and the context in which it is being applied.

Shape Up is particularly well-suited for **product companies** that are focused on building and shipping their own products. The methodology is designed to help these companies make strategic decisions about what to build next and to ensure that they are consistently delivering value to their customers. It is less well-suited for agencies or consulting firms that are working on client projects with fixed scopes and deadlines. The principle of fixed time, variable scope, which is central to Shape Up, can be difficult to implement in a client-facing environment where there is often a contractual obligation to deliver a specific set of features.

The methodology is also a good fit for **small to medium-sized teams**. The emphasis on small, autonomous teams of 2-3 people makes it a natural fit for organizations that are not heavily layered with management and bureaucracy. While the principles of Shape Up can be applied in larger organizations, it may require more effort to create the kind of environment of trust and autonomy that the methodology relies on. In larger organizations, it may be more effective to pilot Shape Up with a single team or department before attempting a company-wide rollout.

In terms of project types, Shape Up is best for **new feature development** and **major product improvements**. The six-week cycle is designed for projects that are substantial enough to require a dedicated period of focus, but not so large that they cannot be completed within that timeframe. It is not well-suited for bug fixes, minor tweaks, or ongoing maintenance work. These types of tasks are better handled during the cool-down period or by a separate team that is dedicated to reactive work. The methodology is also a good fit for projects where there is a degree of uncertainty and the solution is not fully known at the outset. The shaping process is designed to de-risk these projects and provide a clear direction, while still leaving room for the team to discover the best solution as they build.

## 5. Implementation

_Guidance on how to introduce and apply the pattern in a real-world setting._

Implementing Shape Up requires a significant shift in mindset and process. It is not something that can be done overnight. It requires a deliberate and thoughtful approach, as well as a commitment from leadership to create the right environment for the methodology to succeed. The book itself suggests several different ways to get started with Shape Up, from a full-scale adoption to a more gradual, experimental approach.

One of the first steps in implementing Shape Up is to **educate the team**. Everyone involved, from the CEO to the individual contributors, needs to understand the core principles and practices of the methodology. The best way to do this is to have everyone read the Shape Up book, which is available for free online. This will ensure that everyone is on the same page and has a shared understanding of what they are trying to achieve. It is also helpful to have a discussion with the team to address any questions or concerns they may have about the new methodology.

Once the team is on board, the next step is to **start small**. Instead of trying to implement the entire methodology at once, it is often better to start with a single, six-week experiment. This involves selecting a single project, shaping it, and then giving a small team the full six weeks to build it. This allows the team to experience the full cycle of the methodology in a controlled and low-risk way. At the end of the six weeks, the team can reflect on what worked well and what didn’t, and then decide whether to continue with the methodology.

Another approach is to **start with shaping**. This involves introducing the practice of shaping projects before they are considered for development, without immediately adopting the six-week cycles or the betting table. This can be a good way to improve the quality of project definition and to reduce the amount of uncertainty and risk in the development process. Once the team has become proficient at shaping, they can then introduce the other elements of the methodology.

Regardless of the approach taken, it is important to **be patient and flexible**. It will take time for the team to get used to the new way of working. There will be challenges and setbacks along the way. It is important to be open to feedback and to be willing to adapt the methodology to fit the specific needs of the team and the organization. The goal is not to follow the methodology dogmatically, but to use it as a tool to help the team build better products.

## 6. Evidence & Impact

_Empirical evidence, case studies, or observed effects of applying the pattern._

While Shape Up is a relatively new methodology, it has already had a significant impact on the way many companies build products. The most compelling evidence for its effectiveness comes from Basecamp itself, the company that created it. Basecamp has been using the principles and practices of Shape Up for many years, and they have been instrumental in the company’s ability to consistently ship high-quality products with a small team. The company’s success and its reputation for thoughtful and well-designed software are a testament to the power of the methodology.

Since the publication of the Shape Up book in 2019, many other companies have adopted the methodology and have reported positive results. These companies range from small startups to large enterprises, and they operate in a variety of industries. Many of these companies have shared their experiences through blog posts, conference talks, and case studies. These accounts provide valuable insights into the real-world application of Shape Up and the impact it can have on a team’s productivity, morale, and ability to deliver value to customers.

One of the most commonly reported benefits of Shape Up is **increased focus and productivity**. By working in six-week cycles on a single, well-defined project, teams are able to eliminate distractions and focus on the task at hand. This leads to a significant increase in the amount of work that can be accomplished in a given period of time. Another common theme is **reduced stress and burnout**. The cool-down period between cycles provides a much-needed break from the pressure of project work and allows team members to recharge and work on other things. The emphasis on team autonomy and trust also contributes to a more positive and empowering work environment.

Of course, Shape Up is not without its challenges. Some teams have reported difficulty in adapting to the principle of fixed time, variable scope. Others have found it challenging to implement the methodology in a larger organization with more complex dependencies and communication channels. However, even in these cases, many teams have found that the benefits of Shape Up outweigh the challenges. By providing a clear and structured framework for product development, Shape Up can help teams of all sizes to build better products and to have a more enjoyable and rewarding experience doing it.

## 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

_How the pattern might evolve or be applied in the context of AI, machine learning, and other cognitive technologies._

As we move deeper into the cognitive era, where AI and machine learning are becoming increasingly integrated into our lives and work, it is worth considering how a methodology like Shape Up might evolve and adapt. While Shape Up was developed in the context of traditional software development, its core principles of focus, autonomy, and deliberate decision-making are likely to become even more relevant in a world where the nature of work is being transformed by intelligent technologies.

One of the ways that AI could impact Shape Up is by **augmenting the shaping process**. AI-powered tools could be used to analyze user feedback, market trends, and other data sources to help shapers identify the most promising project ideas. Machine learning models could also be used to simulate different solution designs and to predict their potential impact, helping shapers to make more informed decisions about the scope and appetite of a project. This could lead to a more data-driven and evidence-based approach to shaping, while still preserving the human element of creativity and judgment.

AI could also play a role in the **building process**. Intelligent coding assistants could help developers to write code more quickly and with fewer errors. AI-powered testing tools could be used to automate the process of quality assurance, freeing up developers to focus on more creative and challenging tasks. This could allow teams to accomplish even more within a six-week cycle, or it could enable them to tackle more ambitious and complex projects. However, it is important to ensure that these tools are used in a way that supports, rather than undermines, the autonomy and problem-solving skills of the team.

Perhaps the most interesting area of exploration is the intersection of Shape Up and **generative AI**. As large language models and other generative technologies become more powerful, it is possible that they could be used to automate aspects of the product development process itself. For example, a shaper could provide a high-level description of a project, and a generative model could produce a detailed pitch, complete with user stories, wireframes, and even a working prototype. This could dramatically accelerate the shaping process and allow teams to move from idea to execution much more quickly. However, it also raises important questions about the role of human creativity and the nature of design in a world where much of the work can be automated.

## 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

_An analysis of how the pattern aligns with the principles of a commons-based approach, considering seven key dimensions._

Shape Up, while originating from a commercial entity, exhibits several characteristics that align with a commons-based approach to production and governance. This assessment evaluates the methodology against seven dimensions of commons alignment.

| Dimension | Alignment | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Open & Accessible** | High | The entire methodology is documented in a free online book, making it accessible to anyone with an internet connection. There are no licensing fees or certifications required to use it. |
| **2. Modular & Granular** | High | The practices within Shape Up are modular and can be adopted incrementally. A team can start with just six-week cycles, or just the shaping process, without having to adopt the entire framework at once. |
| **3. Collaborative & Participatory** | Medium | While the building phase is highly collaborative within the small, autonomous team, the shaping and betting phases are intentionally limited to a small group of senior members. This is a departure from a more radically participatory model. |
| **4. Distributed & Decentralized** | Medium | The methodology promotes decentralized execution by empowering small, autonomous teams. However, the strategic decision-making (betting) is centralized. |
| **5. Resource Pooling & Sharing** | Low | The methodology itself does not explicitly address the pooling and sharing of resources beyond the immediate team. It is focused on the production process within a single organization. |
| **6. Governance & Stewardship** | Medium | The betting table acts as a form of stewardship, guiding the allocation of development resources. However, the governance model is not explicitly community-driven in the way a true commons would be. |
| **7. Purpose-Oriented & Value-Driven** | High | Shape Up is explicitly designed to focus on shipping *meaningful* work that matters. It pushes teams to think about the underlying purpose and value of what they are building, rather than just blindly executing a backlog. |

Overall, Shape Up has a **medium** alignment with commons principles. Its strengths lie in its openness, modularity, and value-driven approach. The areas for improvement from a commons perspective are in fostering broader participation in strategic decisions and in explicitly encouraging the sharing of resources and knowledge beyond the boundaries of a single organization.
