# Red Ocean vs Blue Ocean

## 1. Overview

The concepts of Red Ocean and Blue Ocean strategy, introduced by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne, provide a framework for understanding and navigating the competitive landscape of the business world [1]. These two concepts represent fundamentally different approaches to strategy and market creation. A Red Ocean strategy focuses on competing in existing market spaces, where companies strive to outperform their rivals to gain a larger share of the existing demand. In contrast, a Blue Ocean strategy is about creating new, uncontested market spaces, thereby making the competition irrelevant [2].

Red Oceans are characterized by well-defined industry boundaries, established competitive rules, and a focus on incremental improvements and value-cost trade-offs. As more competitors enter the market, the space becomes crowded, leading to intense, often cutthroat, competition, which turns the ocean “bloody” with the fight for market share. This environment often leads to commoditization, price wars, and shrinking profit margins [2].

Blue Oceans, on the other hand, represent untapped market space, where demand is created rather than fought over. These are the industries that are not in existence today, the unknown market spaces. In Blue Oceans, there is ample opportunity for profitable and rapid growth. The rules of the game are yet to be set, and the competition is irrelevant because the market is new and uncontested. Blue Ocean Strategy is not about being the first to market, but about being the first to create a new market [1].

## 2. Core Principles

The foundation of Blue Ocean Strategy is built upon a set of core principles that guide the creation of new market spaces. These principles challenge the conventional wisdom of competitive strategy and provide a roadmap for companies to break away from the red ocean of competition.

At the heart of Blue Ocean Strategy is **value innovation**. This is the simultaneous pursuit of differentiation and low cost, which breaks the value-cost trade-off that is the cornerstone of Red Ocean strategy. Value innovation is not about making incremental improvements; it is about making a leap in value for both the buyers and the company. By offering a fundamentally new and superior value proposition, companies can attract a mass of buyers and create a new market space [2].

Another core principle is the **reconstructionist view of strategy**. This view posits that market boundaries and industry structures are not fixed and can be reconstructed by the actions and beliefs of industry players. This is in stark contrast to the structuralist, or deterministic, view that underpins Red Ocean strategy, which assumes that companies are constrained by existing market conditions. Blue Ocean strategists do not take the industry conditions as a given; they aim to reshape them in their favor [2].

The pursuit of Blue Ocean strategy is also guided by a **systematic and repeatable process**. It is not the result of a random or unstructured process of trial and error. Instead, it is based on a set of analytical tools and frameworks that help companies to identify and create new market spaces in a structured and systematic way. This process helps to minimize the risks associated with new market creation and to maximize the opportunities for success [1].

Finally, Blue Ocean Strategy emphasizes the importance of **building execution into strategy**. The process and tools are designed to be inclusive, easy to understand, and visual, which helps to build a broad-based support for the new strategy within the organization. This ensures that the new strategy is not only well-conceived but also effectively implemented [1].

## 3. Key Practices

Blue Ocean Strategy is not just a theoretical concept; it is a practical framework that is supported by a set of powerful tools and methodologies. These tools help companies to analyze the existing market space, to identify new market opportunities, and to create and execute a Blue Ocean strategy.

The **Strategy Canvas** is a central diagnostic tool and a cornerstone of Blue Ocean Strategy. It is a visual tool that captures the current state of play in the known market space. It helps companies to understand the factors that the industry competes on and where the competition is currently investing. The strategy canvas allows a company to see, in a single picture, the strategic profiles of the key players in the industry and to identify the areas where it can differentiate itself from the competition [2].

The **Four Actions Framework** is a tool that is used to challenge the strategic logic of an industry and to create a new value curve. It poses four key questions to guide the creation of a new value proposition:

*   **Eliminate:** Which of the factors that the industry takes for granted should be eliminated?
*   **Reduce:** Which factors should be reduced well below the industry’s standard?
*   **Raise:** Which factors should be raised well above the industry’s standard?
*   **Create:** Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered? [2]

By answering these four questions, companies can systematically explore how to reconstruct buyer value elements across alternative industries to create a new value curve and a new market space.

The **Six Paths Framework** is a tool that helps managers to look at familiar data from a new perspective to create new market space. It provides six systematic paths to expand the boundaries of existing markets and to create new ones:

1.  **Look Across Alternative Industries:** A company can create a new market space by looking at the alternatives that buyers have to its industry’s offerings.
2.  **Look Across Strategic Groups Within Industries:** Strategic groups are groups of companies within an industry that pursue a similar strategy. By understanding why buyers trade up or down between strategic groups, a company can create a new market space.
3.  **Look Across the Chain of Buyers:** In most industries, there is a chain of buyers who are directly or indirectly involved in the buying decision. By shifting the focus from the traditional buyer to a previously overlooked group of buyers, a company can unlock new value.
4.  **Look Across Complementary Product and Service Offerings:** In most cases, a product or service is used in conjunction with other products or services. By looking at the complementary products and services that are used by buyers, a company can identify new opportunities to create value.
5.  **Look Across Functional or Emotional Appeal to Buyers:** Some industries compete primarily on functional appeal, while others compete on emotional appeal. By shifting the appeal from functional to emotional, or vice versa, a company can create a new market space.
6.  **Look Across Time:** All industries are subject to external trends that affect their business over time. By looking at how these trends will change the value that buyers are looking for, a company can create a new market space [2].



## 4. Application Context

Blue Ocean Strategy can be applied in a wide range of contexts, from startups to established corporations, and from for-profit businesses to non-profit organizations. The principles and tools of Blue Ocean Strategy are universally applicable, regardless of the industry, the size of the organization, or the nature of the market.

For **startups and new ventures**, Blue Ocean Strategy provides a framework for creating new market spaces and avoiding the intense competition of established markets. By identifying and creating a Blue Ocean, startups can establish a strong competitive advantage and achieve rapid and profitable growth. The case of Cirque du Soleil is a powerful example of how a new venture can create a Blue Ocean in a declining industry and achieve phenomenal success [3].

For **established corporations**, Blue Ocean Strategy offers a way to break out of the red ocean of competition and to find new avenues for growth. In many mature industries, growth is slow, and competition is fierce. By applying the principles of Blue Ocean Strategy, established companies can create new market spaces and new demand, thereby revitalizing their business and driving new growth. The example of the Ford Model T shows how an established player can create a Blue Ocean and reshape an entire industry [2].

For **non-profit organizations and the public sector**, Blue Ocean Strategy can be used to create innovative solutions to social and public problems. By applying the principles of value innovation, non-profit organizations can create new ways to deliver value to their beneficiaries and to achieve their social missions more effectively. The Blue Ocean strategy has been applied in various public sector areas, such as public transportation, public safety, and public health, to create innovative and cost-effective solutions.

## 5. Implementation

The implementation of Blue Ocean Strategy is a systematic process that involves a series of steps, from understanding the current strategic landscape to creating and executing a new strategy. The process is designed to be inclusive and participatory, involving a broad range of people from across the organization.

The first step in the process is to **get a clear picture of the current strategic landscape**. This involves using the strategy canvas to map the strategic profiles of the key players in the industry and to understand the factors that the industry competes on. This step helps to identify the assumptions that the industry takes for granted and the areas where there is potential for differentiation [2].

The second step is to **explore the six paths to creating new market spaces**. This involves using the Six Paths Framework to look for new market opportunities beyond the boundaries of the existing industry. This step helps to generate new ideas for creating value and for reconstructing market boundaries [2].

The third step is to **reconstruct buyer value elements** using the Four Actions Framework. This involves challenging the strategic logic of the industry and creating a new value curve. This step helps to create a new value proposition that is both differentiated and low-cost [2].

The fourth step is to **solidify the new strategy**. This involves communicating the new strategy to the entire organization and aligning the value, profit, and people propositions. This step helps to ensure that the new strategy is not only well-conceived but also effectively implemented [1].

## 6. Evidence & Impact

The impact of Blue Ocean Strategy can be seen in the numerous companies that have successfully created new market spaces and achieved sustained high performance. The evidence shows that companies that create Blue Oceans can reap significant benefits, including rapid growth, high profitability, and a strong brand reputation.

One of the most compelling pieces of evidence for the impact of Blue Ocean Strategy is the study of business launches conducted by Kim and Mauborgne. Their research found that while 86% of business launches were line extensions in red oceans, they accounted for only 62% of total revenues and 39% of total profits. In contrast, the 14% of launches that were aimed at creating blue oceans generated 38% of total revenues and a staggering 61% of total profits. This shows that Blue Ocean strategy can have a disproportionately large impact on a company’s bottom line [2].

Moreover, companies that create Blue Oceans often enjoy a period of uncontested market leadership, with credible challenges emerging only after 10 to 15 years. This is because Blue Ocean strategy creates significant barriers to imitation, including economies of scale, network externalities, and cognitive barriers. The case of Cirque du Soleil, which enjoyed a long period of uncontested success, is a testament to the sustainability of the competitive advantage that can be achieved through Blue Ocean strategy [3].

The impact of Blue Ocean Strategy is not limited to the company that creates the Blue Ocean. It can also have a positive impact on the industry as a whole. By creating new demand and new market space, Blue Ocean strategy can lead to the growth of the entire industry. The creation of the personal computer industry by Apple is a case in point. By creating a new market for personal computers, Apple not only achieved phenomenal success for itself but also laid the foundation for the growth of an entire new industry [2].



## 7. Cognitive Era Considerations

The Cognitive Era, characterized by the rise of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data, presents both new opportunities and new challenges for Blue Ocean Strategy. On the one hand, the tools and technologies of the Cognitive Era can be powerful enablers of Blue Ocean creation. On the other hand, they can also intensify the competition in red oceans, making it even more important for companies to find new market spaces.

AI and machine learning can be used to analyze vast amounts of data and to identify new patterns and insights that can lead to the creation of new market spaces. For example, AI can be used to analyze customer data to identify unmet needs and to develop new products and services that meet those needs. It can also be used to analyze industry data to identify the factors that the industry competes on and to find new ways to differentiate from the competition.

Big data can also be a powerful tool for Blue Ocean creation. By collecting and analyzing large amounts of data, companies can gain a deeper understanding of their customers and their markets. This can help them to identify new market opportunities and to develop new value propositions that are tailored to the specific needs of their customers. For example, a company could use big data to identify a new segment of customers that is not being served by the existing players in the market and to develop a new product or service that is specifically designed for that segment.

However, the Cognitive Era also presents new challenges for Blue Ocean Strategy. The same technologies that can be used to create Blue Oceans can also be used to intensify the competition in red oceans. For example, AI can be used to automate tasks and to reduce costs, which can lead to price wars and to the commoditization of products and services. This makes it even more important for companies to find new market spaces where they can escape the bloody competition of the red ocean.

## 8. Commons Alignment Assessment

Commons-based peer production, open-source software, and other forms of collaborative innovation are increasingly important in the digital economy. The principles of Blue Ocean Strategy can be applied to these new forms of organization to create new market spaces and to generate new value for the commons.

From a commons perspective, Blue Ocean Strategy can be seen as a way to create new “commons” of knowledge, resources, and capabilities. By creating new market spaces, companies can also create new opportunities for collaboration and for the sharing of knowledge and resources. For example, a company that creates a new open-source software project is also creating a new commons of code that can be used and improved by anyone.

The Commons Alignment Assessment for the Red Ocean vs. Blue Ocean pattern is as follows:

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Openness & Transparency** | 4 | The principles of Blue Ocean Strategy are open and transparent, and the tools and frameworks are freely available to anyone who wants to use them. |
| **Decentralization & Federation** | 3 | Blue Ocean Strategy can be applied in a decentralized way, with different teams and individuals working on different parts of the process. However, the overall direction is often set by a central leadership team. |
| **Collaboration & Peer Production** | 3 | Blue Ocean Strategy can be a collaborative process, involving people from across the organization. However, it is not inherently a peer production model. |
| **Sustainability & Resilience** | 4 | By creating new market spaces, Blue Ocean Strategy can help to create more sustainable and resilient business models that are less dependent on the fluctuations of existing markets. |
| **Fairness & Equity** | 3 | Blue Ocean Strategy can lead to a more equitable distribution of value, by creating new opportunities for growth and for the creation of new jobs. However, it does not explicitly address issues of fairness and equity. |
| **Community & Culture** | 4 | Blue Ocean Strategy can help to build a strong community and culture of innovation within an organization. By involving people from across the organization in the process, it can help to create a sense of ownership and of shared purpose. |
| **Purpose & Values** | 3 | The purpose of Blue Ocean Strategy is to create new market spaces and to generate new value. While this can be aligned with a broader social or environmental purpose, it is not an inherent part of the framework. |
| **Overall Commons Alignment Score** | **3** | While Blue Ocean Strategy is not explicitly a commons-based approach, it shares many of the same values and principles. It is a powerful framework for creating new value and for building more sustainable and resilient organizations. |
